# Boot Fix for USB Build System v1.3.0

## Problem
USB devices were not booting - going directly to BIOS. This was because the build system only supported UEFI boot, not legacy BIOS.

## Solution
Added dual boot support for both UEFI and legacy BIOS systems.

### Changes Made:

1. **Partition Layout** (03-partition.sh):
   - Added BIOS boot partition (1MB) at beginning for legacy BIOS with GPT
   - Partition 1: BIOS boot partition (1MB)
   - Partition 2: EFI partition (512MB) 
   - Partition 3: Root partition (remaining space)

2. **Mount Points** (04-mount.sh):
   - Updated to use partition 3 for root (was 2)
   - Updated to use partition 2 for EFI (was 1)

3. **GRUB Installation** (11-filesystem.sh):
   - Added `grub-install --target=i386-pc` for legacy BIOS
   - Added `--removable` flag to UEFI install for better compatibility
   - Both installations use `|| true` to continue if one fails

4. **Package Installation** (06-system-config.sh):
   - Added `grub-pc` and `grub-pc-bin` packages for BIOS support

5. **fstab Configuration** (11-filesystem.sh):
   - Updated UUIDs to use correct partition numbers

## Testing
After these changes, the USB should boot on:
- Modern UEFI systems
- Legacy BIOS systems  
- Systems with Secure Boot disabled
- Both GPT and MBR compatible systems

## Version
Bumped build script version to 1.3.0 to reflect this significant change.
