# Refactoring Fixes Summary - v1.3.1

## What Was Lost in Refactoring

During the refactoring from monolithic to modular (v1.2.3), several critical features were lost:

### 1. **Power Failure Resistance** ❌ CRITICAL
- **Root filesystem was NOT read-only** - This made the system vulnerable to corruption
- **Missing journal data mode** - Less protection against data loss
- **No ro/rw helper commands** - Made maintenance difficult

### 2. **Boot Support** ❌ CRITICAL  
- **Only UEFI boot worked** - Legacy BIOS systems couldn't boot
- **Missing BIOS boot partition** - Required for BIOS+GPT
- **Missing grub-pc packages** - Required for BIOS installation

### 3. **System Optimizations** ⚠️ IMPORTANT
- **Missing vm.swappiness=10** - Could cause performance issues
- **Missing fast boot timeouts** - Slower boot times

## What Was Fixed in v1.3.0

✅ Added dual UEFI/BIOS boot support:
- Added BIOS boot partition (1MB)
- Install GRUB for both UEFI and legacy BIOS
- Added grub-pc packages
- Updated partition layout

## What Was Fixed in v1.3.1

✅ Restored power failure resistance:
- Added new module: `14-power-resistance.sh`
- Root filesystem mounts as read-only
- Added journal data mode for ext4
- Added ro/rw helper commands
- Added system optimizations (swappiness, timeouts)

## Current Status

The modular build system (v1.3.1) now has:
- ✅ All features from the monolithic version
- ✅ Better organization and maintainability  
- ✅ Enhanced dual boot support
- ✅ Power failure resistance
- ✅ All original helper scripts

## Testing Checklist

After building with v1.3.1:

```bash
# 1. Check boot works on both UEFI and BIOS systems
# 2. Verify filesystem is read-only
mount | grep " / "  # Should show 'ro'

# 3. Check journal mode
tune2fs -l /dev/sdb3 | grep "Default mount"  # Should show 'journal_data'

# 4. Test helper commands
ndi-bridge-rw  # Should remount read-write
ndi-bridge-ro  # Should remount read-only

# 5. Test power failure resistance
# Pull power during operation, system should boot normally
```

## Lesson Learned

When refactoring working code:
1. Create comprehensive feature tests first
2. Compare outputs systematically
3. Don't assume all features are obvious in the code
4. Test on real hardware, not just build completion
