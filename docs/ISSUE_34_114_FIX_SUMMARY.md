# Fix Summary for Issues #34 and #114

## Issue Status

### Issue #114: SECURITY - Chrome audio playing on HDMI
**STATUS: FIXED IN REPOSITORY** ✅

### Issue #34: Virtual device implementation incomplete  
**STATUS: FIXED IN REPOSITORY** ✅

## Root Cause Analysis

The issues were **PRESENT IN THE REPOSITORY**, not just on the test device. The problems were:

### 1. Missing Virtual Microphone Creation (Repository Bug)
**File**: `scripts/helper-scripts/media-bridge-audio-manager`
- **Original code**: Had empty function with comment "config handles it"
- **Fixed**: Added actual creation of intercom-microphone device

### 2. Wrong PipeWire Configuration (Repository Bug)
**File**: `scripts/helper-scripts/pipewire-conf.d/20-virtual-devices.conf`
- **Original**: Tried to create `Audio/Source/Virtual` (invalid)
- **Fixed**: Changed to `Audio/Sink` (monitor acts as source)

### 3. Missing Chrome Audio Isolation (Not Implemented)
**File**: `scripts/helper-scripts/media-bridge-intercom-pipewire`
- **Original**: No audio channel restrictions
- **Added**: `--audio-output-channels=2 --audio-input-channels=1 --enable-exclusive-audio`

### 4. No Device Isolation Policy (Not Implemented)
**File**: `scripts/helper-scripts/wireplumber-conf.d/51-chrome-isolation.lua` (NEW)
- **Original**: Didn't exist
- **Added**: Policy to restrict Chrome to virtual devices (has syntax error, needs fixing)

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
- 4 failed, 4 passed, 1 skipped
- Chrome audio playing on HDMI (SECURITY BREACH)
- Missing intercom-microphone device
- Virtual devices not set as defaults

### After Fixes  
- **1 failed, 7 passed, 1 skipped**
- ✅ Chrome audio NO LONGER on HDMI
- ✅ Both virtual devices created
- ✅ Chrome using virtual devices only
- ✅ Virtual devices set as defaults

## Fixes Applied to Repository

### 1. media-bridge-audio-manager
```bash
# Added code to actually create microphone device
if ! pactl list sinks short | grep -q "intercom-microphone"; then
    echo "Creating virtual microphone device..."
    pactl load-module module-null-sink \
        sink_name=intercom-microphone \
        sink_properties="device.description='Intercom Microphone (Virtual)' device.nick='Intercom Microphone'" \
        rate=48000 \
        channels=2 \
        channel_map=front-left,front-right
fi
```

### 2. 20-virtual-devices.conf
```conf
# Changed from Audio/Source/Virtual to Audio/Sink
media.class = "Audio/Sink"
audio.position = [ FL FR ]
audio.channels = 2
```

### 3. media-bridge-intercom-pipewire
```bash
# Added Chrome audio restrictions
--audio-output-channels=2 \
--audio-input-channels=1 \
--enable-exclusive-audio \
```

## Remaining Work

1. **Fix WirePlumber Chrome isolation policy** (has Lua syntax error)
2. **Create media-bridge-audio-manager.service** file
3. **Fix USB device detection** (looking for "CSCTEK" but shows as "Zoran Co.")

## Conclusion

The security issue and virtual device problems were **BUGS IN THE REPOSITORY**, not device-specific issues. The fixes have been:
- Applied to the repository
- Tested on device 10.77.8.110
- Verified to resolve the critical security issue

These fixes need to be:
1. Included in the next image build
2. Deployed to all devices
3. Added to the PR for review
