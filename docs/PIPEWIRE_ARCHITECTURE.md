# Unified PipeWire Architecture

## Executive Summary
The unified PipeWire architecture (v2.2.5) implements a system-wide audio solution for Media Bridge. This is necessary because Ubuntu/Debian do NOT provide system-wide PipeWire services - only user session services that refuse to run as root (`ConditionUser=!root`). This document describes our custom implementation for embedded/headless systems.

**Latest Update (v2.2.5)**: RESOLVED cold boot socket creation issues with auto-recovery mechanism and proper service configuration. PipeWire now reliably starts on fresh images.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Single System-Wide PipeWire Instance
- **Before**: Multiple PipeWire instances (user sessions + system)
- **After**: Single system-wide instance at `/var/run/pipewire/`
- **Benefits**: 
  - Simplified audio routing
  - Consistent state management
  - Reduced resource usage
  - No session conflicts

### 2. Why Custom System Services Are Necessary

**Ubuntu/Debian Limitation**: PipeWire packages only provide user session services:
- Located in `/usr/lib/systemd/user/`
- Contains `ConditionUser=!root` - refuses to run as root
- Designed for desktop environments with user login sessions
- Not suitable for headless/embedded systems

**Our Solution**: Custom system-wide services with trigger socket:
- `pipewire-system.socket` - Trigger socket only (NOT for socket passing!)
- `pipewire-system.service` - Core audio server (creates its own sockets)
- `pipewire-pulse-system.service` - PulseAudio compatibility
- `wireplumber-system.service` - Session/policy management

### 3. Virtual Audio Devices
Created persistent virtual devices for Chrome isolation:
- `intercom-speaker` - Virtual speaker for Chrome output
- `intercom-microphone` - Virtual microphone for Chrome input
- Prevents Chrome from locking physical USB devices
- Managed by `media-bridge-audio-manager`

### 4. Configuration Files

#### PipeWire Configuration (`/etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/`)
- `10-media-bridge.conf` - Core system settings, runtime directory
- `20-virtual-devices.conf` - Virtual device definitions

#### WirePlumber Configuration (`/etc/wireplumber/main.lua.d/`)
- `50-media-bridge.lua` - Low-latency settings, monitoring config
- `50-usb-audio.lua` - USB audio device enablement

### 5. Runtime Management
- PipeWire creates its own sockets at `/run/user/0/pipewire-0` and `/run/user/0/pipewire-0-manager`
- PulseAudio socket at `/run/user/0/pulse/native`
- XDG_RUNTIME_DIR set to `/run/user/0` for all services
- **CRITICAL**: Never let systemd create PipeWire's actual sockets!

## Testing Results

## Known Issues and Solutions

### PipeWire Socket Activation Issues (RESOLVED in v2.2.5)

**Critical Discovery**: PipeWire on Ubuntu/Debian has race conditions during cold boot when run as system service!

**Problem**: PipeWire starts but doesn't create its socket on cold boot, causing WirePlumber and dependent services to fail.

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- PipeWire is NOT designed to use systemd's socket passing mechanism (sd_listen_fds)
- When systemd creates sockets via ListenStream, PipeWire cannot accept connections on them
- PipeWire MUST create its own sockets at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/pipewire-0`
- On cold boot, PipeWire may fail to create sockets due to timing/initialization issues
- Manual restart always works, indicating a race condition during system startup

**Why Socket Creation Failed on Cold Boot**:
1. PipeWire requires specific environment and runtime directory setup
2. Default Ubuntu PipeWire config may not load all required modules on first start
3. System resources/dependencies may not be fully available at boot time
4. Configuration directory resolution can fail when PIPEWIRE_CONFIG_DIR is set incorrectly

**Complete Solution Implemented (v2.2.5)**:

1. **Trigger Socket Approach**:
   - Use `pipewire-trigger` socket for activation (not the actual PipeWire socket)
   - Allows systemd to manage service startup without interfering with PipeWire's socket creation

2. **Service Configuration Fixes**:
   - Removed `PIPEWIRE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable (causes config loading issues)
   - Added explicit config path: `/usr/bin/pipewire -c /usr/share/pipewire/pipewire.conf`
   - Added startup delay: `ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 2` to let system settle
   - Added dependency on `systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service` for runtime directories

3. **Auto-Recovery Mechanism**:
   - Implemented self-healing in ExecStartPost
   - If socket doesn't exist after 5 seconds, service auto-restarts
   - Ensures socket creation even if first attempt fails

4. **WirePlumber Synchronization**:
   - Added wait loop in WirePlumber for PipeWire socket
   - Up to 20 seconds wait time (100 iterations × 0.2s)
   - Prevents WirePlumber from failing before PipeWire is ready

**Final Working Configuration (v2.2.5)**:

```ini
# pipewire-system.socket
[Socket]
ListenStream=/run/user/0/pipewire-trigger

# pipewire-system.service
[Unit]
After=sound.target pipewire-system.socket systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service
Requires=pipewire-system.socket
Wants=systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service

[Service]
Environment="XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/0"
Environment="PIPEWIRE_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/0"
# NO PIPEWIRE_CONFIG_DIR - causes issues!
ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 2
ExecStart=/usr/bin/pipewire -c /usr/share/pipewire/pipewire.conf
# Auto-restart if socket not created
ExecStartPost=/bin/bash -c 'sleep 5; if [ ! -S /run/user/0/pipewire-0 ]; then systemctl restart pipewire-system; fi'

# wireplumber-system.service
[Service]
# Wait for PipeWire socket before starting
ExecStartPre=/bin/bash -c 'for i in {1..100}; do [ -S /run/user/0/pipewire-0 ] && exit 0; sleep 0.2; done; exit 1'
```

**Verification in v2.2.5 Image**:
- Built and verified image contains all fixes
- Services properly configured with correct dependencies
- Configuration files in place at `/etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/`
- All PipeWire/WirePlumber services enabled in multi-user.target

### Ubuntu/Debian System-Wide Limitation
**Critical Finding**: Ubuntu/Debian do NOT support system-wide PipeWire officially
- All distribution packages are for user sessions only
- Service files contain `ConditionUser=!root` blocking root execution
- Official recommendation is using `loginctl enable-linger` with user accounts
- System-wide operation requires custom service files (what we've implemented)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### WirePlumber Can't Connect to PipeWire
**Symptoms**: `Failed to connect to PipeWire` error, tests timeout

**Check**:
```bash
# Is PipeWire creating its socket?
ls -la /run/user/0/pipewire-0

# Is systemd trying to create the socket?
systemctl status pipewire-system.socket

# Check PipeWire logs
journalctl -u pipewire-system -n 50
```

**Solution**: Ensure socket unit uses trigger socket, not actual PipeWire socket path

#### Socket Activation Not Working
**Symptoms**: PipeWire starts but can't accept connections

**Root Cause**: PipeWire doesn't support systemd socket passing (sd_listen_fds)

**Solution**: 
- Use trigger socket (`/run/user/0/pipewire-trigger`)
- Let PipeWire create its own sockets
- Add ExecStartPost check to verify socket creation

#### Services Start But Audio Doesn't Work
**Check**:
```bash
# Are all services running?
systemctl status pipewire-system wireplumber-system pipewire-pulse-system

# Are virtual devices created?
pactl list sinks short | grep intercom

# Is Chrome connected?
pactl list clients | grep chrome
```

#### Build Creates Wrong Configuration
**Ensure**:
1. Socket file uses trigger socket path
2. Service file has `Requires=pipewire-system.socket`
3. Service file has ExecStartPost socket check
4. WirePlumber waits for actual PipeWire socket

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Deployments
1. System will auto-migrate on update
2. Old user-session configs ignored
3. Virtual devices created automatically
4. Chrome will use new devices after restart

### Breaking Changes
- None for end users
- Internal audio paths changed
- Developer tools must use system paths

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. Dynamic quantum adjustment based on load
2. Per-stream priority management
3. Advanced echo cancellation
4. Spatial audio support

### Known Limitations
1. Requires PipeWire 0.3.65+ 
2. Virtual devices fixed at creation
3. Single quantum for all streams
4. No per-application volume (by design)

## Lessons Learned

### Key Discoveries About PipeWire

1. **PipeWire Socket Activation is Different**
   - PipeWire doesn't use systemd's socket passing (sd_listen_fds)
   - It MUST create its own sockets - systemd can't create them for it
   - Trigger sockets work, actual socket passing doesn't
   - This is undocumented in official PipeWire documentation

2. **System-Wide PipeWire Challenges**
   - Ubuntu/Debian packages explicitly block root operation
   - No official support for system-wide deployment
   - Must create custom service files from scratch
   - Default configurations assume user sessions

3. **Service Dependencies Are Critical**
   - WirePlumber must wait for actual PipeWire socket
   - Not the systemd socket unit, but the socket PipeWire creates
   - Race conditions are common without proper checks
   - ExecStartPost verification prevents cascade failures

4. **Testing on Fresh Images is Essential**
   - What works on a configured box may fail on fresh boot
   - Socket activation issues only appear on cold boot
   - Always test with `systemctl daemon-reload` and full reboot
   - Build process must match manual configuration exactly

## Conclusion

The unified PipeWire architecture successfully:
1. **Simplifies** audio management 
2. **Improves** reliability and consistency
3. **Reduces** resource usage
4. **Enables** low-latency monitoring
