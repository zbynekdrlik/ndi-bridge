## Output Format

| Feature | Original | Refactored | Notes |
|---------|----------|------------|-------|
| **Device Enumeration Format** | `Device 0: Name` | `0: Name` | Minor difference |
| **Verbose Logging** | Limited | Extensive | More detailed in refactored |
| **Version on Startup** | ❌ | ✅ | Shows version automatically |
| **Module Prefixes** | ❌ | ✅ | [AppController], [NdiSender], etc. |

## Summary

### Features Added in Refactored Version:
1. Structured command-line argument parsing
2. --list-devices option
3. --version and --help options
4. Signal handling for clean shutdown
5. Frame statistics tracking
6. NDI connection counting
7. Modular, maintainable architecture
8. Cross-platform structure
9. Configurable retry attempts
10. Extensive logging system

### Features Fixed in v1.0.5:
1. ✅ Interactive device selection menu
2. ✅ Interactive NDI name input
3. ✅ Positional parameter support
4. ✅ Wait for Enter in CLI mode
5. ✅ Device re-enumeration verification

### Minor Differences:
- Device listing format slightly different (but functionally equivalent)
- More verbose logging in refactored version
- Better error messages and status reporting

The refactored version (v1.0.5) now has **feature parity** with the original code, plus many improvements.
