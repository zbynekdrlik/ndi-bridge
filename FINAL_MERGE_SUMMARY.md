# FINAL MERGE SUMMARY: feature/status-monitoring → main

## Version: 1.6.8
**Build Status:** ✅ SUCCESSFUL  
**Image File:** `ndi-bridge.img` (4GB)  
**Build Time:** ~12 minutes

## Branch Statistics
- **10 commits** ready for merge
- **16 files modified**
- **646 insertions(+), 592 deletions(-)**
- **Net improvement:** 54 lines with major new features

## Key Features Added

### 1. Real-Time Operational Dashboard (v1.6.5-1.6.7)
- **Live FPS monitoring** with color coding (green >59, yellow >55, red <55)
- **10-minute performance history** with min/max/avg statistics
- **Network throughput** monitoring from actual br0 interface
- **Frame drop tracking** (fixed critical bug where drops were never counted)
- **Device disconnection detection** - shows "NO DEVICE" when USB removed
- **PTP/NTP status** independent of USB device state

### 2. Web Interface Improvements (v1.6.8)
- **Clean URL behavior** - stays at `ndi-bridge.local` (no `/terminal` redirect)
- **Stable tmux sessions** - reverted aggressive resets that caused disconnections
- **Shared terminal view** - multiple browsers see same session (useful for support)

### 3. Critical Bug Fixes
- **Dropped frames tracking** - `stats_.frames_dropped` was NEVER being updated
- **GRUB boot delay** - Fixed 30-second delay after power failures
- **PTP independence** - Now correctly shows as available even without USB device
- **--version command** - Fixed hanging on hardware initialization

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- **Removed 183 lines of duplicate inline scripts**
- **Simplified CLAUDE.md** from 338 to 101 lines
- **Structured metrics logging** for monitoring
- **Improved build timestamp** to show local timezone

## Testing Status
✅ Tested on production devices (10.77.8.105-108)  
✅ All features verified working  
✅ Clean v1.6.8 build completed

## Deployment Ready
