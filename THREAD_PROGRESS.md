## Completed Work Summary

### Issues Fixed
1. **Compilation Errors**: 
   - Fixed Windows macro conflicts (ERROR, LOG_*) by using LVL_* enum names
   - Fixed localtime security warning with localtime_s on Windows
   - Removed Logger usage before initialization in parseArgs()
   - **Fixed missing wideToUtf8 declaration in mf_capture_device.h**

2. **Version Management**:
   - Fixed hardcoded versions in AppController (was 1.0.3)
   - Fixed hardcoded versions in NdiSender (was 1.0.2)
   - All components now use NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION from version.h

3. **Logging Consistency**:
   - Created new Logger class with format: `[module_name] [timestamp] message`
   - Updated all components to use new Logger
   - Added timestamps with milliseconds
   - Implemented log levels: LVL_INFO, LVL_WARNING, LVL_ERROR, LVL_DEBUG

### Components Updated
- logger.h/cpp - New implementation
- main.cpp - Uses Logger except in parseArgs()
- app_controller.cpp - Full Logger integration
- ndi_sender.cpp - Full Logger integration
- media_foundation_capture.cpp - Full Logger integration
- mf_capture_device.cpp - Full Logger integration with string conversion
- mf_capture_device.h - Added wideToUtf8 declaration
- mf_video_capture.cpp - Full Logger integration

### Version
- Bumped from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1

## Latest Fix
User reported compilation error:
```
Error C3861 'wideToUtf8': identifier not found
```
Fixed by adding the missing declaration to mf_capture_device.h:
```cpp
static std::string wideToUtf8(const std::wstring& wide);
```

## Initial Test Results
User ran initial test showing:
- Main app logs correctly: `[ndi-bridge] [2025-07-15 21:00:33.498] Script version 1.2.1 loaded`
- Issues found and fixed:
  - AppController had wrong version (fixed)
  - NdiSender not using Logger (fixed)
  - MediaFoundation components not using Logger (fixed)

## Next Thread Goals
User has identified improvements for next thread:
1. **Single Version Source**: Remove separate version logging for each component
   - Currently each component logs "Script version X.Y.Z loaded"
   - Should have single version for entire application
   - Version should be sourced from one place only

2. **Simplify Log Format**: Remove module name from log format
   - Current: `[module_name] [timestamp] message`
   - Proposed: `[timestamp] message`
   - Reasoning: In compiled exe, module names are not helpful

## User Actions Required
1. Rebuild the project with the fixed header
2. Test the complete implementation
3. Verify all logging is consistent
4. Provide feedback on current format
5. Approve for merge or request additional changes

## Branch Information
- Working branch: feature/consistent-logging  
- Base branch: main
- Version: 1.2.1
- PR: #7 - https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/ndi-bridge/pull/7

## Handoff Notes for Next Thread
1. Review current Logger implementation in logger.h/cpp
2. Consider removing Logger::logVersion() calls from individual components
3. Update log format to remove module_name_ prefix
4. Ensure single version source (likely just main.cpp startup)
5. Test thoroughly to ensure no component identification issues

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-15 21:13
- Action: Reported compilation error with wideToUtf8
- Result: Fixed by adding declaration to header file
- Next Required: Rebuild and test
