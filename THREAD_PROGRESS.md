# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] GOAL 3 COMPLETED: All integration components implemented (v1.0.3)
- [x] All compilation errors fixed
- [x] Project structure complete and verified
- [ ] Currently working on: Setting up NDI SDK library placement
- [ ] Waiting for: User to configure NDI SDK
- [ ] Blocked by: NDI SDK location not configured

## NEW GOAL 4: Configure NDI SDK Library Placement
**Objective**: Set up the NDI SDK in the correct location for successful compilation

### NDI SDK Setup Options:

#### Option 1: Local Project Directory (Recommended for portability)
Place NDI SDK files in: `deps/ndi/`
```
ndi-bridge/
├── deps/
│   └── ndi/
│       ├── include/
│       │   └── Processing.NDI.Lib.h
│       └── lib/
│           └── x64/
│               ├── Processing.NDI.Lib.x64.lib
│               └── Processing.NDI.Lib.x64.dll
```

#### Option 2: System Installation
Install NDI SDK from https://ndi.video/for-developers/ndi-sdk/
- Default location: `C:/Program Files/NDI/NDI 5 SDK/` or `C:/Program Files/NDI/NDI 6 SDK/`

#### Option 3: Environment Variable
Set `NDI_SDK_DIR` environment variable to point to NDI SDK root:
```
set NDI_SDK_DIR=C:\path\to\ndi\sdk
```

### Required NDI SDK Files:
1. **Header**: `Processing.NDI.Lib.h`
2. **Library**: `Processing.NDI.Lib.x64.lib` (for linking)
3. **DLL**: `Processing.NDI.Lib.x64.dll` (for runtime)

### Next Steps:
1. Download NDI SDK if not already available
2. Choose placement option
3. Copy/install NDI SDK files
4. Rebuild project

## Implementation Status
- Phase: NDI SDK Configuration
- Step: Library placement setup
- Status: WAITING_FOR_NDI_SDK
- Version: 1.0.3

## Previous Goals Completed:
### ✅ GOAL 1: Initial Project Structure

- Set up CMake configuration
- Added documentation templates

### ✅ GOAL 2: Media Foundation Refactoring
- Modularized capture code
- Created reusable components
- Improved error handling

### ✅ GOAL 3: Integration Components (v1.0.3)
- Main application implemented
- NDI sender module created
- Application controller developed
- All compilation errors fixed

## Build Instructions (After NDI SDK Setup)
```bash
# Visual Studio with built-in CMake:
1. Open Visual Studio
2. File -> Open -> Folder (select project root)
3. Select x64-Debug or x64-Release configuration
4. Build -> Build All

# Output will be in:
out/build/x64-Debug/bin/ndi-bridge.exe
or
out/build/x64-Release/bin/ndi-bridge.exe

# Traditional CMake build:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build . --config Release
```

## Command-Line Options
- `-d, --device <n>`: Capture device name (default: first available)
- `-n, --ndi-name <n>`: NDI sender name (default: 'NDI Bridge')
- `-l, --list-devices`: List available capture devices
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose logging
- `--no-retry`: Disable automatic retry on errors
- `--retry-delay <ms>`: Delay between retries (default: 5000)
- `--max-retries <count>`: Maximum retry attempts (-1 for infinite)
- `-h, --help`: Show help message
- `--version`: Show version information

1. ✅ Initial project structure created
2. ✅ Media Foundation code refactored into modules
3. ✅ All components committed to repository
4. ✅ Deep code verification completed

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-13 13:46:00
- Action: Requested to save state and set goal for NDI lib placement
- Result: State saved, Goal 4 created for NDI SDK configuration
- Next Required: Configure NDI SDK in one of the suggested locations

## Notes
- All C++ code compilation errors resolved
- Project version 1.0.3 ready for build
- NDI SDK is the only remaining dependency to configure
- Three options available for NDI SDK placement
- Recommend Option 1 (deps/ndi/) for project portability
- After NDI SDK setup, project should build successfully
