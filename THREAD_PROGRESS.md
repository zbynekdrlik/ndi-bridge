## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Decklink color space conversion fix - v2
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test the updated color fix (v1.5.2)
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Bug Fix - Decklink Color Space (Iteration 2)
- Step: Updated implementation complete, awaiting testing
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
- Version: 1.5.2

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Color Space Detection | ✅ v1.5.2 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| BT.709 Conversion | ✅ v1.5.2 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| BT.601 Conversion | ✅ v1.5.2 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Limited Range YUV | ✅ v1.5.2 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Issue Description
User reported that Decklink video capture has incorrect/faded colors compared to OBS. Initial fix attempted auto-detection of YUV range, but user confirmed OBS shows:
- YUV range: limited
- YUV color space: BT.709

## Solution Implemented (v2)
1. **Color Space Detection**: HD (≥720p) uses BT.709, SD uses BT.601
2. **Limited Range YUV**: Force limited range conversion (16-235 for Y, 16-240 for UV)
3. **Removed Auto-detection**: No longer auto-detect range, always use limited range
4. **Proper Scaling**: Correct conversion from limited to full range RGB

## Version History
- v1.5.1: Initial color fix with auto-detection (had issues)
- v1.5.2: Fixed to force limited range YUV (matches OBS)

## Changes Made (Latest)
- Updated `BasicFormatConverter.cpp` to force limited range YUV
- Simplified conversion coefficients
- Better matches OBS handling of Decklink input
- Removed problematic auto-detection logic
- Incremented version to 1.5.2

## Testing Required
User needs to:
1. Pull latest changes from fix/decklink-color-space branch
2. Rebuild the project
3. Test with Decklink capture device
4. Verify version shows as 1.5.2 in logs
5. Compare colors with OBS output
6. Verify colors now match correctly

## Last Actions
- Date/Time: 2025-07-16 17:43
- Action: Updated to v1.5.2 with forced limited range YUV
- Result: Code changes committed to fix/decklink-color-space branch
- Next Required: User testing with v1.5.2

## Branch State
- Branch: `fix/decklink-color-space`
- Version: 1.5.2
- Commits: 5 (initial fix, v1.5.1, thread progress, limited range fix, v1.5.2)
- Ready for testing

## Technical Details
The fix now:
- Always assumes limited range YUV from Decklink (matching OBS)
- Converts Y from [16,235] to [0,255]
- Converts UV from [16,240] to [-112,112]
- Uses proper BT.709 coefficients for HD content

## Next Steps
1. User tests v1.5.2
2. Verify colors match OBS exactly
3. If successful, merge PR #10
4. If issues persist, may need to investigate Decklink API color flags
