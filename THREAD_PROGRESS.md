# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Media Foundation source file received and analyzed
- [x] Created abstract capture interface (capture_interface.h)
- [x] Refactored Media Foundation code into modular components
- [x] All refactored files committed to repository
- [ ] Currently working on: Setting up verification goal
- [ ] Waiting for: New thread to perform deep comparison
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Code Refactoring - Verification Required
- Step: Need to verify refactored code matches original functionality
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_VERIFIED

## Current Goal: Deep Code Comparison
**GOAL 2**: Perform deep comparison between refactored code and original source to verify no functionality lost

### Verification Plan
1. **Line-by-line comparison of functionality**
   - All error codes preserved
   - All conversion functions identical
   - Device enumeration logic matches
   - Capture loop behavior preserved
   - Retry/reinit logic intact

2. **Check for missing features**
   - Command-line parameter handling
   - User input handling (Enter key to stop)
   - Console output messages
   - All format conversions (YUY2, NV12, UYVY)
   - Error recovery mechanisms

3. **Verify architectural improvements**
   - Separation of concerns achieved
   - No global variables in new design
   - Thread safety improvements
   - Proper resource management

4. **Create verification checklist**
   - Document each function's migration
   - Note any intentional changes
   - Flag any missing functionality

## Refactoring Progress

### Media Foundation Refactoring ✅ COMPLETE (NOT VERIFIED)
Successfully refactored monolithic Media Foundation source into:

1. **Error Handling** (`mf_error_handling.h/cpp`)
   - HRESULT to string conversion ✅
   - Error checking utilities ✅
   - Device error detection ✅
   - RAII wrappers for COM/MF initialization ✅

2. **Format Conversion** (`mf_format_converter.h/cpp`)
   - YUY2 to UYVY conversion ✅
   - NV12 to UYVY conversion ✅
   - Generic format conversion dispatcher ✅
   - Buffer size calculations ✅

3. **Device Management** (`mf_capture_device.h/cpp`)
   - Device enumeration ✅
   - Device lookup by name ✅
   - Source reader creation ✅
   - Configuration utilities ✅

4. **Video Capture** (`mf_video_capture.h/cpp`)
   - Capture loop implementation ✅
   - Format negotiation ✅
   - Frame delivery via callbacks ✅
   - Error recovery ✅

5. **Main Interface** (`media_foundation_capture.h/cpp`)
   - Implements ICaptureDevice interface ✅
   - Coordinates all MF components ✅
   - Provides clean API for application ✅

### Features That Need Verification:
- Command-line parameter parsing (argc/argv)
- NDI integration (was in original main())
- User input handling (_kbhit(), _getch())
- Console output formatting
- Retry delays and timing
- All error codes handled correctly
- Frame buffer management
- Device re-enumeration on errors

## Next Steps (for new thread)
1. **Load original source file** (provided in this thread)
2. **Load all refactored files** from repository
3. **Create comparison matrix** showing:
   - Original function → New location
   - Original feature → Implementation status
   - Missing elements → Action required
4. **Document any gaps** found during comparison
5. **Create integration plan** for missing pieces (main app, NDI wrapper)

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Analyzed monolithic Media Foundation source code
2. ✅ Created abstract capture interface
3. ✅ Extracted error handling utilities
4. ✅ Extracted format conversion utilities
5. ✅ Extracted device enumeration/management
6. ✅ Extracted video capture logic
7. ✅ Created main MF capture implementation
8. ✅ Committed all files to repository
9. ✅ Updated PR with progress

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-11 09:15:00
- Action: Requested to save state and set verification goal
- Result: Thread progress updated with new verification goal
- Next Required: Start new thread to perform deep code comparison

## Original Source Reference
The original Media Foundation source file is saved in this thread's history and contains:
- 600+ lines of monolithic code
- Main() function with command-line handling
- Direct NDI integration
- Global variables for capture state
- All functionality in single file

## Notes for Next Thread
- **CRITICAL**: Must verify ALL functionality preserved
- Original source available in thread history
- All refactored files in feature/initial-project-setup branch
- Look for missing main() function logic
- Check for missing NDI integration
- Verify command-line parameter handling
- Ensure all error paths covered
