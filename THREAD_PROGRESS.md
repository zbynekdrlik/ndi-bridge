## v1.2.1 24/7 Operation Improvements

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ **Removed Enter key handling**
   - Removed `isKeyPressed()` function
   - Removed `clearInput()` function
   - Updated main loop to only wait for shutdown signal

2. ✅ **Updated user interface**
   - Help text now mentions Ctrl+C instead of Enter
   - Running message says "Press Ctrl+C to stop..."
   - Removed "Press Enter to exit" in positional parameter mode

3. ✅ **Cleaner shutdown**
   - Final statistics display moved to shutdown handler
   - Consistent shutdown behavior across all modes

### Testing Required:
```bash
cmake --build . --config Release --clean-first
ndi-bridge.exe -t dl -l
ndi-bridge.exe -t dl
```

Verify:
- App does NOT exit when Enter is pressed
- App ONLY exits with Ctrl+C
- Final statistics are displayed on shutdown
- No console input issues

## Implementation Status
