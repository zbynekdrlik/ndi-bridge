# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Fixed zero-copy implementation - v1.4.0 updated
- [ ] Waiting for: User to rebuild and test the fixed version
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Performance Optimization - Priority 1 (Zero-Copy YUV)
- Step: Zero-copy path now properly implemented
- Status: TESTING_STARTED (initial test showed conversion still happening)
- Version: 1.4.0 (fixed)

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| NDI YUYV Support | ✅ v1.4.0 | ❌ | ✅ Working | ❌ |
| AVX2 YUYV→UYVY | ✅ v1.4.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Zero-Copy Path | ✅ v1.4.0 (fixed) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| V4L2 processFrame | ✅ v1.4.0 (fixed) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Issue Found and Fixed

### Problem in First Test
- V4L2 was still converting YUYV to BGRA instead of using zero-copy
- Logs showed: "V4L2FormatConverter: Using AVX2 accelerated YUYV->BGRA conversion"
- Latency was still 16ms (not improved)

### Fix Applied
- Updated `v4l2_capture.cpp` processFrame method to detect YUYV format
- Added zero-copy path that skips BGRA conversion entirely
- YUYV frames now passed directly to NDI sender
- Added statistics tracking for zero-copy frames

## Commands to Test Fixed Version
```bash
# Pull the fix
cd /home/ubuntu/ndi-test/ndi-bridge
git pull origin feature/linux-performance-optimization

# Rebuild
cd build
make clean
make -j$(nproc)

# Run with verbose logging
sudo ./bin/ndi-bridge --device /dev/video0 --ndi-name "NZXT-Optimized" -v
```

## Expected Logs (Fixed Version)
You should now see:
- "V4L2Capture: Using zero-copy path for YUYV format" ✅ NEW
- "NDI sender: Using direct YUYV->UYVY conversion (zero-copy optimization)"
- "NDI sender: AVX2 support detected for YUV conversions"
- NO MORE "V4L2FormatConverter: Using AVX2 accelerated YUYV->BGRA conversion"

## Expected Performance (After Fix)
- Latency should drop from 16ms → ~5-7ms
- CPU usage should be lower
- Stats should show zero-copy frames incrementing

## Debug Commands
```bash
# Monitor in real-time
watch -n 0.1 'sudo ./bin/ndi-bridge --device /dev/video0 --ndi-name "NZXT-Optimized" -v 2>&1 | grep -E "(latency|zero-copy|Zero-copy)"'

# Check CPU usage
htop

# Detailed performance
sudo perf stat -e cycles,instructions,cache-misses ./bin/ndi-bridge --device /dev/video0
```

## Next Steps After Successful Test

### If Zero-Copy Working (latency < 10ms):
1. Confirm performance metrics
2. Move to Priority 2: Multi-threaded Pipeline
3. Target additional -2ms reduction

### If Still Not Working:
1. Check YUYV detection logic
2. Add more debug logging
3. Verify NDI is accepting UYVY format

## Notes
- The fix was to properly implement the zero-copy path in processFrame
- YUYV format detection was missing in the original implementation
- Now YUYV frames bypass the format converter entirely
- This should give the expected 3ms latency reduction

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-16 14:10
- Action: Ran v1.4.0 and found it was still converting to BGRA
- Result: Identified missing zero-copy implementation
- Next Required: Test the fixed version with proper zero-copy path
