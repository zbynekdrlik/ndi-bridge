## Documentation Consistency Findings
During the deep research, I found:
1. **Version mismatch**: README showed v1.5.0 but actual version is v1.6.5
2. **Missing features**: DeckLink optimizations from v1.6.x not documented
3. **Outdated metrics**: Performance highlights didn't include DeckLink improvements
4. All other documentation appears consistent and up-to-date

1. User to review and merge PR #12
2. After merge, delete `fix/update-readme-to-v165` branch
3. Check TODO.md for next priority item
4. Consider "Code Consolidation" task marked as HIGH PRIORITY

- CHANGELOG.md: Complete through v1.6.5
- README.md: Will be updated via PR #12
- Design philosophy: Followed (simple documentation fix)
