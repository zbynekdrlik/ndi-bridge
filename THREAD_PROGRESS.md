# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed frame rate issue - NDI now uses actual capture rate (v1.1.5)
- [x] Fixed statistics display - shows stats when Enter pressed (v1.1.5)
- [x] Improved Media Foundation cleanup (v1.1.5)
- [ ] Currently working on: Waiting for user to test v1.1.5 fixes
- [ ] Waiting for: User to rebuild and test all fixes
- [ ] Blocked by: Need test results before PR merge

## GOAL 11: Test and Fix v1.1.3 Issues (IN PROGRESS)
### Objective: Identify and fix functionality issues

### Status: v1.1.5 FIXES IMPLEMENTED - TESTING REQUIRED

### Issues Fixed in v1.1.5:
1. **Frame Rate Mismatch** ✅
   - Was: NDI hardcoded to 30fps while capture was 60fps
   - Fixed: NDI now uses actual frame rate from capture device
   - Updated: NdiSender v1.0.2, AppController v1.0.2

2. **No Statistics on Enter** ✅
   - Was: No frame stats displayed when pressing Enter
   - Fixed: Added final statistics display before shutdown
   - Shows: Captured/Sent/Dropped frames with drop percentage

3. **Media Foundation Cleanup** ✅
   - Improved shutdown sequence to prevent crashes
   - Added proper COM object cleanup order
   - Will be tested with NZXT device

### Issues Previously Fixed in v1.1.4:
1. **Version Display Bug** ✅
2. **Media Foundation Startup Issue** ✅
3. **DeckLink Frame Drop Crisis** ✅

### Testing Required:
1. **Clean rebuild of v1.1.5**
   ```
   cmake --build . --config Release --clean-first
   ```

2. **Test Media Foundation**
   ```
   ndi-bridge.exe -t mf -l
   ndi-bridge.exe  (select MF device)
   ```
   - Verify NDI shows 60fps (not 30fps)
   - Press Enter and verify statistics display
   - Check no crash on close

3. **Test DeckLink**
   ```
   ndi-bridge.exe -t dl -l
   ndi-bridge.exe  (select DL device)
   ```
   - Verify frame drops still minimal
   - Press Enter and verify statistics

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Bug Fixing
- Step: v1.1.5 fixes implemented, awaiting test results
- Status: TESTING_REQUIRED
- Version: 1.1.5

## Code Changes Summary v1.1.5

### ndi_sender.h (v1.0.2)
- Added fps_numerator and fps_denominator to FrameInfo struct

### ndi_sender.cpp (v1.0.2)
- Uses actual frame rate from FrameInfo instead of hardcoded 30fps

### app_controller.cpp (v1.0.2)
- Passes frame rate from capture device to NDI sender

### main.cpp (v1.1.5)
- Added statistics display when Enter key pressed
- Shows Captured/Sent/Dropped frames with percentage

### media_foundation_capture.cpp (v1.0.8)
- Improved destructor with proper cleanup order
- Enhanced shutdownDevice() with COM object cleanup
- Added flush and proper shutdown sequence

## Next Steps
1. User rebuilds with v1.1.5
2. Test all capture types
3. Verify all fixes work:
   - Frame rate matches capture device
   - Statistics display on Enter
   - No crash on close
4. If successful, merge PR
5. If issues remain, debug and fix

## PR Status
- PR #2: "Fix v1.1.3 Runtime Issues"
- Branch: feature/fix-v1.1.3-issues
- Ready for v1.1.5 testing

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-15 (earlier in session)
- Action: Reported frame rate mismatch and no stats on Enter
- Result: Implemented fixes in v1.1.5
- Next Required: Rebuild and test v1.1.5
