## v1.2.4 Media Foundation USB Device Fix

### Issue Reported:
- USB capture card disconnects monitor when app closes
- Requires power reset of USB capture card to restore monitor
- Reference codes and third-party apps don't have this issue

### Root Cause Found:
The `shutdownDevice()` method was intentionally NOT calling:
- `Shutdown()` on the media source
- `ShutdownObject()` on the activate object

This kept the USB device in an active state even after app exit.

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ **Fixed media_foundation_capture.cpp**
   - Added proper `Shutdown()` call on media source
   - Added proper `ShutdownObject()` call on activate object
   - Added `full_shutdown` parameter to control behavior
   - Ensures full cleanup in destructor

2. ✅ **Updated header file**
   - Added overloaded `shutdownDevice(bool full_shutdown)` method
   - Maintains backward compatibility

3. ✅ **Version bump**
   - Updated to 1.2.4

### Testing Required:
```bash
cmake --build . --config Release --clean-first
ndi-bridge.exe -t mf -l
ndi-bridge.exe -t mf
```

Verify:
- App exits cleanly with Ctrl+C
- Monitor REMAINS CONNECTED after app exit (KEY TEST)
- No need to power reset USB capture card
- Can restart app and capture again without issues
- USB device is properly released

## Implementation Status
- Phase: BUG FIX
- Step: Code complete, needs testing
- Status: TESTING_REQUIRED
- Version: 1.2.4

## Previous Context
- Previous work was v1.2.3 removing Enter key handling
- That PR #4 was merged successfully
- Current issue is specific to Media Foundation USB devices

## Media Foundation Best Practices
According to Microsoft documentation, proper cleanup requires:
1. Stop capture
2. Flush source reader
3. **Call Shutdown() on media source** (was missing)
4. **Call ShutdownObject() on activate** (was missing)
5. Release all COM objects

The missing Shutdown calls were causing the USB device to remain active.

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-15 (current session)
- Action: Reported USB capture card monitor disconnection issue
- Result: Found and fixed improper device shutdown
- Next Required: Compile and test the fix
