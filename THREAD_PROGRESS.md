# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed frame rate issue - NDI now uses actual capture rate (v1.1.5)
- [x] Fixed statistics display - shows stats when Enter pressed (v1.1.5)
- [x] Improved Media Foundation cleanup (v1.1.6)
- [ ] Currently working on: Waiting for user to test v1.1.6 NZXT fix
- [ ] Waiting for: User to rebuild and test if NZXT card issue is resolved
- [ ] Blocked by: Need test results before PR merge

## GOAL 11: Test and Fix v1.1.3 Issues (IN PROGRESS)
### Objective: Identify and fix functionality issues

### Status: v1.1.6 NZXT FIX IMPLEMENTED - TESTING REQUIRED

### Issues Fixed in v1.1.6:
1. **NZXT Capture Card Shutdown Issue** üöß
   - Problem: NZXT card loses input signal after app exit, requires power cycle
   - Analysis: App was doing full device shutdown, not suitable for continuous operation
   - Fix: Only stop capture on exit, don't shutdown device completely
   - Changed: Removed Stop()/Shutdown()/ShutdownObject() calls during normal operation
   - Version: MediaFoundationCapture v1.0.9

### Issues Fixed in v1.1.5:
1. **Frame Rate Mismatch** ‚úÖ
   - Was: NDI hardcoded to 30fps while capture was 60fps
   - Fixed: NDI now uses actual frame rate from capture device
   - Updated: NdiSender v1.0.2, AppController v1.0.2

2. **No Statistics on Enter** ‚úÖ
   - Was: No frame stats displayed when pressing Enter
   - Fixed: Added final statistics display before shutdown
   - Shows: Captured/Sent/Dropped frames with drop percentage

### Issues Previously Fixed in v1.1.4:
1. **Version Display Bug** ‚úÖ
2. **Media Foundation Startup Issue** ‚úÖ
3. **DeckLink Frame Drop Crisis** ‚úÖ

### Testing Required:
1. **Clean rebuild of v1.1.6**
   ```
   cmake --build . --config Release --clean-first
   ```

2. **Test NZXT Capture Card**
   ```
   ndi-bridge.exe -t mf -l
   ndi-bridge.exe  (select NZXT device)
   ```
   - Let it run for a bit
   - Press Enter to stop
   - Verify monitor connected to NZXT still works
   - No need to power cycle NZXT

3. **Test DeckLink** (regression test)
   ```
   ndi-bridge.exe -t dl -l
   ndi-bridge.exe  (select DL device)
   ```
   - Verify still works properly
   - Frame drops still minimal

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Bug Fixing
- Step: v1.1.6 NZXT fix implemented, awaiting test results
- Status: TESTING_REQUIRED
- Version: 1.1.6

## Code Changes Summary v1.1.6

### media_foundation_capture.cpp (v1.0.9)
- Modified shutdownDevice() to avoid full device shutdown
- Only stop capture on normal exit, keep device initialized
- Full shutdown only in destructor or error recovery
- Removed Stop()/Shutdown()/ShutdownObject() calls
- This prevents NZXT from losing input signal

### media_foundation_capture.h
- Added IMFMediaSource* member for proper tracking

### version.h
- Updated to v1.1.6

## Next Steps
1. User rebuilds with v1.1.6
2. Test NZXT capture card specifically:
   - Run app with NZXT
   - Exit normally
   - Verify monitor still works without power cycle
3. Regression test DeckLink
4. If successful, merge PR
5. If issues remain, debug further

## PR Status
- PR #2: "Fix v1.1.3 Runtime Issues"
- Branch: feature/fix-v1.1.3-issues
- Ready for v1.1.6 testing

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-15 (current session)
- Action: Reported NZXT card loses input on app exit
- Result: Implemented proper cleanup in v1.1.6
- Next Required: Rebuild and test v1.1.6
