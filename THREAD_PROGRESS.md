# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed version.h compilation error
- [ ] Currently working on: Ready for second build attempt
- [ ] Waiting for: User to build the project again
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## CURRENT GOAL 4: Configure NDI SDK Library Placement
**Status**: CONFIGURATION COMPLETE ✅

### What was done:
- Updated CMakeLists.txt to v1.0.4
- Fixed NDI 6 SDK paths to use capital case (Include/Lib/Bin)
- Added proper DLL detection using find_file
- Fixed DLL copy command to use actual found path
- Added validation for all NDI components
- Fixed version.h - added NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION alias

### Build Error Fixed:
- main.cpp was looking for `NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION`
- version.h defined `NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION_STRING`
- Added alias: `#define NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION_STRING`

### Next Steps:
1. **Build the project again**:
   ```bash
   # In Visual Studio:
   - Build -> Rebuild All
   ```
2. **Verify build output** in `out/build/x64-Debug/bin/`
3. **Test basic functionality**
4. **Begin unit testing**

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Build and Test
- Step: Second build attempt after version fix
- Status: READY_TO_BUILD
- Version: 1.0.4
