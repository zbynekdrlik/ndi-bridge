# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Media Foundation latency optimization v1.6.7
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test v1.6.7 (removed sleep in capture loop)
- [ ] Blocked by: Need latency measurement results

## Implementation Status
- Phase: **Latency Fix** - Media Foundation optimizations
- Step: v1.6.7 pushed, awaiting testing
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
- Version: 1.6.7

## Media Foundation Latency Fix Progress
**v1.6.6 Results**:
- Reduced latency from 14 frames to 10 frames
- Improvements:
  - NDI clock_video=false (immediate delivery)
  - Removed 5ms sleep (initially)
  - Added MF low-latency attributes

**v1.6.7 Changes**:
- ✅ Removed remaining 5ms sleep in capture loop
- ✅ Now uses tight loop when no sample available
- ✅ Added CMake option MF_SYNCHRONOUS_MODE for future use
- ✅ Updated version to 1.6.7
- ⏳ Should reduce latency from 10 frames closer to 8 frames

## Remaining Latency Sources
After v1.6.7, if latency is still above 8 frames:
1. **Threading overhead** (1-2 frames):
   - Capture thread → Main thread → NDI thread
   - Each thread hop adds synchronization delay
   - Solution: Implement synchronous mode (MF_SYNCHRONOUS_MODE)

2. **Possible future optimizations**:
   - Direct ReadSample → NDI send in main thread
   - Remove all intermediate buffering
   - Match reference implementation's synchronous model

## Testing Required
- Build v1.6.7 with standard settings
- Test with 60fps camera
- Measure roundtrip latency
- Target: 8-9 frames (down from 10)

If still above 8 frames:
- Build with: `cmake -DMF_SYNCHRONOUS_MODE=ON ..`
- Implement synchronous capture mode
- Test again for final 8-frame target

## Repository State
- Main branch: v1.6.5
- Open PRs: #12 (README update), #13 (latency fix)
- Current branch: fix/media-foundation-latency (v1.6.7)
- Compilation: Fixed all errors

## Next Steps
1. User tests v1.6.7 build
2. If latency ≤ 8 frames: SUCCESS! Update PR #13
3. If latency > 8 frames:
   - Implement synchronous mode using MF_SYNCHRONOUS_MODE flag
   - Remove capture thread entirely
   - Direct capture → NDI pipeline
4. Once latency target achieved:
   - Update PR #13 description
   - Merge PR #13
   - Consider merging PR #12

## Quick Reference
- Current version: 1.6.7
- Branch: fix/media-foundation-latency
- PR: #13
- Key fixes:
  - v1.6.6: NDI clock_video=false + MF attributes
  - v1.6.7: Removed ALL sleeps in capture loop
- Next optimization: Synchronous mode (if needed)
