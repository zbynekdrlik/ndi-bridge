## 🎉 COMPLETED: ZERO-COPY OPTIMIZATION (v1.4.0)

### Performance Achieved:
- **Average Latency**: 16.068ms → **7.621ms** (52% reduction!)
- **Max Latency**: 20.757ms → **17.841ms**
- **FPS**: 55 (excellent for 60fps source)
- **Zero-copy frames**: 550/550 (100%)
- **Dropped frames**: 0

## 🚀 NEW: MULTI-THREADED PIPELINE (v1.5.0)

### What's Implemented:
1. **Lock-free Frame Queues** (`frame_queue.h/cpp`)
   - Ring buffer with atomic operations
   - Pre-allocated memory pool
   - Zero-allocation runtime operation
   - Separate queues for capture→convert and convert→send

2. **Pipeline Thread Pool** (`pipeline_thread_pool.h/cpp`)
   - CPU affinity support for Intel N100
   - Real-time thread priority (if permitted)
   - Performance monitoring per thread
   - Clean shutdown mechanism

3. **3-Thread Architecture** in V4L2 Capture:
   - **Thread 1 (Core 1)**: Capture - polls V4L2, dequeues frames
   - **Thread 2 (Core 2)**: Convert - YUYV→UYVY or format conversion
   - **Thread 3 (Core 3)**: Send - NDI transmission
   - **Core 0**: Reserved for system/other processes

4. **Smart Buffer Management**:
   - BufferIndexQueue for V4L2 buffer recycling
   - Non-blocking operations throughout
   - Queue depth: 5 frames per stage

### Build Instructions:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/ndi-test/ndi-bridge
git pull origin feature/linux-performance-optimization

# Clean rebuild for v1.5.0
rm -rf build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j4

# Version 1.5.0 should be logged on startup
```

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Test multi-threaded mode (default)
sudo ./bin/ndi-bridge --device /dev/video0 --ndi-name "NZXT-MultiThread" -v

# Compare with single-threaded mode (for baseline)
# Note: Single-threaded mode would need to be enabled in code
```

### Expected Results:
- Target: < 6ms average latency (from current 7.6ms)
- CPU usage distributed across cores 1-3
- No increase in dropped frames
- Smooth 60fps maintained

### Performance Monitoring:
```bash
# Monitor thread distribution
htop  # Should show 3 ndi-bridge threads on different cores

# Check latency improvements
watch -n 0.1 'sudo ./bin/ndi-bridge --device /dev/video0 2>&1 | grep -E "Avg latency|Queue drops|Thread"'

# Detailed thread stats (will be in logs)
sudo ./bin/ndi-bridge --device /dev/video0 -v 2>&1 | grep "Thread"
```

### What to Look For in Logs:
1. Version confirmation: `V4L2Capture: Created (version 1.5.0)`
2. Multi-threading enabled: `V4L2Capture: Starting multi-threaded pipeline (v1.5.0)`
3. Thread creation: `V4L2Capture: Multi-threaded pipeline started with 3 threads`
4. Thread stats on shutdown showing processing times
5. Queue drop statistics (should be minimal)

## Success Metrics for Priority 2:
- [ ] Average latency < 6ms achieved
- [ ] CPU usage shows 3 threads on cores 1-3
- [ ] No increase in frame drops vs v1.4.0
- [ ] Smooth 60fps output maintained
- [ ] Thread statistics show balanced load

## Next Steps After Testing:

### If Performance Goal Met (< 6ms):
1. Consider Priority 2 optimization complete
2. Document final performance numbers
3. Prepare for PR merge
4. Move to Priority 3 (hardware timestamping) if needed

### If Performance Goal Not Met:
1. Analyze thread statistics for bottlenecks
2. Consider tuning queue depths
3. Profile with `perf` to identify hot spots
4. May need to optimize conversion further

## Current Branch State:
- Branch: `feature/linux-performance-optimization`
- Version: 1.5.0
- All changes committed and pushed
- PR #9 open - DO NOT MERGE until tested

## Implementation Summary:
- ✅ Zero-copy optimization (v1.4.0) - 52% latency reduction
- ✅ Multi-threaded pipeline (v1.5.0) - implementation complete
- ⏳ Multi-threaded testing - awaiting results
- 🎯 Target: Total latency < 6ms (from original 16ms)

## Notes:
- Multi-threading adds complexity but should improve latency
- If 7.6ms is sufficient, could stay with simpler v1.4.0
- Thread pool is reusable for future optimizations
- Lock-free queues ensure minimal thread contention
