## Changes Summary (v1.3.2 - Bug Fixes)

### Issues Fixed ✅
1. **NV12 AVX2 Conversion Bug** ✅
   - Fixed incorrect vector size casting in processYUV16_AVX2
   - Now properly uses 256-bit vectors throughout
   - Correct UV separation and duplication for NV12 format
   - Handles edge cases (last row) properly

2. **Intel CPU Detection in CMake** ✅
   - Added runtime CPU vendor detection
   - Only applies `-mtune=alderlake` on Intel Alder Lake CPUs
   - Falls back to `-mtune=native` for other Intel CPUs
   - Skips Intel-specific tuning on AMD/other CPUs
   - Prevents potential performance issues on non-Intel systems

3. **Version Properly Updated** ✅
   - Bumped from 1.3.1 to 1.3.2 for bug fix release
   - Version logging confirmed in main.cpp

### v1.3.1 Features (Previously Implemented)
1. **Intel N100 Optimizations**
   - AVX2 Format Conversion (16 pixels at a time)
   - SIMD optimized YUYV, UYVY, and NV12 conversion
   - Runtime CPU feature detection
   - Automatic fallback to scalar code

2. **Improved Buffer Management**
   - Increased buffer count from 6 to 10
   - Better for high-load scenarios
   - Optimized for N100's 6MB L3 cache

3. **Build System Updates**
   - V4L2 header checks
   - AVX2 compiler flag detection
   - Conditional AVX2 source compilation

4. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Pre-allocated conversion buffers
   - Poll-based capture (5ms timeout)
   - Non-blocking I/O
   - Memory-mapped buffers for zero-copy

### Files Modified (v1.3.2)
1. src/linux/v4l2/v4l2_format_converter_avx2.cpp (NV12 fix) ✅
2. CMakeLists.txt (CPU detection) ✅
3. src/common/version.h (v1.3.2) ✅

## PR Status
**PR #8**: [feat: Add Linux USB capture card support (V4L2)](https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/ndi-bridge/pull/8)
- Status: Open
- Files changed: 15
- Additions: +2200 (approximate)
- Deletions: -91
- Ready for: Testing with fixes applied

## Testing Required
- [ ] Build on Linux x64 (Ubuntu 20.04+) with AVX2 support
- [ ] Verify AVX2 detection on Intel N100
- [ ] Test NV12 format conversion (fixed)
- [ ] Test on non-Intel CPU (AMD) to verify CPU detection
- [ ] Test device enumeration
- [ ] Test with USB webcam
- [ ] Test with HDMI capture card (NZXT or similar)
- [ ] Verify format conversion quality
- [ ] Check memory usage and leaks (valgrind)
- [ ] Performance testing (CPU usage < 10% target)
- [ ] Measure AVX2 performance improvement
- [ ] Error handling (device disconnect/reconnect)
- [ ] Long-running stability test
- [ ] Verify version 1.3.2 logged on startup

## Performance Targets (Intel N100)
- 1080p60 capture: < 10% CPU usage
- Frame latency: < 16ms
- Zero frame drops under normal load
- Memory usage: < 200MB
- Format conversion: < 5ms per frame

## Known Limitations
- MJPEG decompression not implemented (requires libjpeg)
- No DeckLink support on Linux (Windows only)
- Focus on USB capture devices only

## Next Steps
1. User to test Linux build on Intel N100 system
2. Verify NV12 conversion works correctly
3. Test CPU detection on different processors
4. Benchmark AVX2 performance improvements
5. Fix any compilation issues
6. Test with actual hardware
7. Address feedback and bugs
8. Consider MJPEG support if needed
9. Merge PR after successful testing

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-16
- Action: Requested to fix issues found in verification
- Result: Fixed NV12 AVX2 bug and CPU detection, v1.3.2
- Next Required: Build and test on Linux system with Intel N100
