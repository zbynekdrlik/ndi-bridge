## Changes Summary (v1.3.4 - Minor Fixes & Improvements)

### Improvements Added ✅
1. **AVX2 Runtime Logging** ✅
   - Added detection logging at startup
   - Logs when AVX2 path is actually used (first time)
   - Clear indication of scalar vs AVX2 code paths
   - Helps verify Intel N100 optimization usage

2. **Version Comment Fix** ✅
   - Fixed AVX2 header version comment from 1.3.2 to 1.3.3
   - Now updated to 1.3.4 with all improvements

3. **Enhanced Logging** ✅
   - "AVX2 optimization AVAILABLE for Intel N100" on detection
   - "Using AVX2 accelerated YUYV->BGRA conversion" when used
   - Similar messages for UYVY and NV12 formats

### v1.3.3 Features (Critical Fixes)
1. **Buffer Overflow in AVX2** (CRITICAL SECURITY FIX)
2. **Non-existent AVX2 Function** (fixed)
3. **Vector Size Corrections** (fixed)
4. **Version Properly Updated**

### v1.3.2 Features (Previous Fix)
1. **NV12 AVX2 Conversion Bug** (partially fixed, completed in v1.3.3)
2. **Intel CPU Detection in CMake**
3. **Version logging**

### v1.3.1 Features (Initial Implementation)
1. **Intel N100 Optimizations**
2. **Improved Buffer Management**
3. **Performance Enhancements**

### Files Modified (v1.3.4)
1. src/linux/v4l2/v4l2_format_converter.h (added avx2_logged_ member) ✅
2. src/linux/v4l2/v4l2_format_converter.cpp (AVX2 runtime logging) ✅
3. src/linux/v4l2/v4l2_format_converter_avx2.h (version comment fix) ✅
4. src/common/version.h (v1.3.4) ✅
5. CMakeLists.txt (v1.3.4) ✅

## Intel N100 Video Encoding Note
**Intel N100 Hardware Encoding Capabilities:**
- Supports Intel Quick Sync Video (QSV)
- H.264/AVC encoding up to 4K 60fps
- H.265/HEVC encoding up to 4K 60fps
- AV1 decoding only (no encoding)
- VP9 decoding only (no encoding)

**Not Currently Used in NDI Bridge:**
- NDI uses its own proprietary codec (NDI HX uses H.264/H.265)
- This app sends raw BGRA frames to NDI SDK
- NDI SDK handles all compression internally
- Future enhancement could use QSV for pre-compression if NDI HX is targeted

## PR Status
**PR #8**: [feat: Add Linux USB capture card support (V4L2)](https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/ndi-bridge/pull/8)
- Status: Open
- Files changed: 15
- Additions: +2200 (approximate)
- Deletions: -91
- Ready for: Final testing with all improvements

## Testing Required
- [ ] Build on Linux x64 (Ubuntu 20.04+) with AVX2 support
- [ ] Verify AVX2 detection logging on Intel N100
- [ ] Verify AVX2 runtime logging when converting frames
- [ ] Test all format conversions (YUYV, UYVY, NV12)
- [ ] Verify no crashes/memory corruption
- [ ] Test on non-Intel CPU (AMD) to verify CPU detection
- [ ] Test device enumeration
- [ ] Test with USB webcam
- [ ] Test with HDMI capture card (NZXT or similar)
- [ ] Verify format conversion quality
- [ ] Check memory usage and leaks (valgrind)
- [ ] Performance testing (CPU usage < 10% target)
- [ ] Measure AVX2 performance improvement
- [ ] Error handling (device disconnect/reconnect)
- [ ] Long-running stability test
- [ ] Verify version 1.3.4 logged on startup

## Performance Targets (Intel N100)
- 1080p60 capture: < 10% CPU usage
- Frame latency: < 16ms
- Zero frame drops under normal load
- Memory usage: < 200MB
- Format conversion: < 5ms per frame

## Known Limitations
- MJPEG decompression not implemented (requires libjpeg)
- No DeckLink support on Linux (Windows only)
- Focus on USB capture devices only
- No hardware encoding used (NDI handles compression)

## Next Steps
1. User to test Linux build on Intel N100 system
2. Verify AVX2 detection and runtime logging
3. Confirm no crashes with all fixes applied
4. Test all format conversions work correctly
5. Benchmark AVX2 performance improvements
6. Test on different CPU architectures
7. Fix any compilation issues
8. Test with actual hardware
9. Address feedback and bugs
10. Merge PR after successful testing

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-16
- Action: Requested minor fixes and AVX2 runtime logging
- Result: Fixed version comment, added AVX2 runtime logging, v1.3.4
- Next Required: Build and test on Linux system with Intel N100

## Critical Notes
⚠️ **DO NOT MERGE WITHOUT TESTING** - The AVX2 buffer overflow was a critical security issue that could cause crashes or worse. Thorough testing is mandatory before merge.

✅ **READY FOR FINAL TESTING** - All known issues have been addressed. Implementation is complete with proper logging to verify AVX2 optimization usage.
