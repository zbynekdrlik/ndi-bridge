# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Root cause found - DeckLink outputting BGRA not UYVY
- [ ] Waiting for: User input on source type OR decision to add BGRA zero-copy
- [ ] Blocked by: Format mismatch - need BGRA zero-copy support

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Latency Optimization - DeckLink TRUE Zero-Copy
- Step: v1.6.5 planning - BGRA zero-copy support
- Status: ROOT_CAUSE_FOUND
- Version: 1.6.4 (tested, format issue identified)

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| DeckLink Zero Latency | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (100% direct) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Direct Frame Callback | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (100% direct) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Pre-allocated Buffers | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (8MB allocated) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Reduced Queue Size | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (bypassed) | ✅ | ❌ |
| TRUE Zero-Copy UYVY | ✅ v1.6.1 | ❌ (wrong format) | ❌ | ❌ |
| DeckLink Callback Fix | ✅ v1.6.2 | ✅ (frames received) | ✅ | ❌ |
| AppController Fix | ✅ v1.6.3 | ✅ (callbacks working) | ✅ | ❌ |
| StartAccess/EndAccess | ✅ v1.6.4 | ✅ (SDK compliant) | ✅ | ❌ |
| BGRA Zero-Copy | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
**Why Zero-Copy Isn't Working**:
- DeckLink is outputting **BGRA** format, not UYVY
- Format detection shows `bmdDetectedVideoInputRGB444`
- Zero-copy only implemented for UYVY format
- Your input source (likely computer HDMI) outputs RGB

**Evidence**:
- No "TRUE ZERO-COPY" log message
- Zero-copy frames: 0%
- Format detection changing pixel format to BGRA

## v1.6.4 Test Results Summary
**Working**:
- ✅ Version 1.6.4 loaded correctly
- ✅ 456 frames captured, 0 dropped
- ✅ Direct callbacks: 100%
- ✅ Stable 59.91 FPS
- ✅ 2 NDI connections active
- ✅ All callback fixes working
- ✅ SDK compliance restored

**Not Working**:
- ❌ Zero-copy frames: 0%
- ❌ Format is BGRA, not UYVY

## Proposed Solution: v1.6.5
**Add BGRA Zero-Copy Support**:
1. NDI natively supports BGRA - no conversion needed!
2. Add ProcessFrameZeroCopyBGRA() method
3. Check for both UYVY and BGRA in OnFrameArrived
4. Achieve zero-copy with current RGB input

**Benefits**:
- Works immediately with current setup
- No format forcing needed
- Follows design philosophy (fastest path)
- Compatible with computer HDMI outputs

## Version History
- v1.6.0: Queue bypass + direct callbacks ✅
- v1.6.1: TRUE zero-copy for UYVY (wrong format assumption)
- v1.6.2: Fixed DeckLink callback order ✅
- v1.6.3: Fixed AppController callback order ✅
- v1.6.4: Restored SDK compliance ✅
- v1.6.5: *Proposed* - Add BGRA zero-copy

## User Action Required
**Option 1**: Tell me your input source type:
- Computer HDMI? (RGB/BGRA output)
- Game console? (YUV output)
- Camera? (YUV output)

**Option 2**: Let me implement BGRA zero-copy (v1.6.5)
- Works with your current RGB input
- Same performance benefit as UYVY zero-copy
- No configuration changes needed

## Branch State
- Branch: `feature/decklink-latency-optimization`
- Version: 1.6.4 (current)
- Commits: 30
- Testing: ROOT CAUSE FOUND
- Status: AWAITING_DECISION
- PR: #11 OPEN

## Next Steps
1. ✅ All infrastructure fixes complete
2. ✅ Root cause identified (BGRA format)
3. ⏳ Implement BGRA zero-copy support
4. ⏳ Test v1.6.5 with BGRA zero-copy
5. ⏳ Achieve 100% zero-copy performance
6. ⏳ Merge PR #11

## Technical Summary
**Current State**:
- DeckLink outputs BGRA (RGB444 detected)
- Zero-copy only works for UYVY
- All other optimizations working perfectly

**Solution**:
- Add BGRA to zero-copy formats
- NDI handles BGRA natively
- No performance penalty
- Works with RGB HDMI sources

## GOAL
Implement BGRA zero-copy to achieve:
- Zero-copy frames: 100%
- Direct callbacks: 100%
- ~40-50ms total latency reduction
- DeckLink matches Linux V4L2 performance
