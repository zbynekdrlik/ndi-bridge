# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Repository created: ndi-bridge
- [x] Feature branch created: feature/initial-project-setup
- [x] README.md updated with comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Currently working on: Setting up project structure
- [ ] Waiting for: User to provide existing Media Foundation and DeckLink source code
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Initial Setup
- Step: Repository and documentation setup
- Status: IMPLEMENTING

## Project Overview
- **Repository**: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/ndi-bridge
- **Purpose**: Low-latency HDMI to NDI bridge for Windows and Linux
- **Key Components**:
  - Windows: Media Foundation + DeckLink SDK
  - Linux: Minimal bootable USB implementation
  - Common: NDI SDK integration

## Next Steps
1. Create directory structure for the project
2. Wait for user to provide existing source code:
   - Media Foundation implementation
   - DeckLink SDK implementation
3. Integrate provided code into project structure
4. Set up CMake build system
5. Create initial PR for tracking

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-11 08:45:00
- Action: Requested creation of ndi-bridge repository
- Result: Repository created successfully
- Next Required: Provide existing Media Foundation and DeckLink source code

## Notes
- User has existing Media Foundation and DeckLink implementations from previous work
- Linux version will be a minimal bootable USB solution
- Focus on low latency is critical
- Multiplatform support (Windows and Linux) is required
