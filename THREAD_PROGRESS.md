# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Fixed compilation errors in fix/media-foundation-latency branch
- [ ] Waiting for: User to build and test v1.6.6 with 60fps camera
- [ ] Blocked by: Need latency measurement results

## Implementation Status
- Phase: **Latency Fix** - Media Foundation optimizations
- Step: PR #13 created, compilation errors fixed
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
- Version: 1.6.6

## Media Foundation Latency Fix (v1.6.6)
**Pull Request #13 - Fix Media Foundation latency regression**
- ✅ Created feature branch: `fix/media-foundation-latency`
- ✅ Identified root causes:
  - NDI clock_video=true was pacing frames (should be false)
  - 5ms sleep in capture loop when no sample
  - Default Media Foundation buffering
- ✅ Implemented fixes:
  - Set NDI clock_video=false for immediate delivery
  - Removed sleep in capture loop (tight loop like reference)
  - Added MF attributes to minimize buffering
- ✅ Updated version to 1.6.6
- ✅ Updated CHANGELOG with detailed entry
- ✅ PR created with comprehensive description
- ✅ Fixed compilation errors:
  - Added missing version constants to version.h (NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION, NDI_BRIDGE_BUILD_TYPE, NDI_BRIDGE_PLATFORM)
  - Updated CMakeLists.txt version to 1.6.6
  - Alignment warnings in frame_queue.h are benign (alignas(64) for cache line optimization)
- ⏳ Awaiting user testing and latency measurements

## Compilation Issues Fixed
1. **Version constants**: main.cpp was using undefined constants
   - Solution: Added NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION, NDI_BRIDGE_BUILD_TYPE, NDI_BRIDGE_PLATFORM to version.h
2. **CMake version mismatch**: CMakeLists.txt had version 1.5.0
   - Solution: Updated to 1.6.6 to match version.h
3. **Alignment warnings**: C4324 warnings for frame_queue.h
   - These are expected due to alignas(64) directives for cache optimization
   - No fix needed - warnings are informational only

## Problem Analysis
- User reported Media Foundation latency regression:
  - Old reference: 8 frames latency
  - Current v1.6.5: 14 frames latency (75% increase, ~100ms @ 60fps)
- Compared with reference implementation in docs/reference/
- Key differences found:
  1. NDI clock_video setting (true vs false)
  2. Sleep in capture loop (5ms vs none)
  3. Threading model (separate thread vs main thread)

## Changes Made
1. **NDI Sender** (ndi_sender.cpp):
   - Set `clock_video=false` for immediate frame delivery
   - Added logging to confirm low-latency mode

2. **Media Foundation Capture** (mf_video_capture.cpp):
   - Removed 5ms sleep when no sample available
   - Added MF attributes for minimal buffering:
     - MF_READWRITE_DISABLE_CONVERTERS
     - MF_SOURCE_READER_DISABLE_DXVA
     - MF_SOURCE_READER_ENABLE_VIDEO_PROCESSING=FALSE
     - MF_LOW_LATENCY=TRUE

3. **Version**: Updated to 1.6.6 across all files

## Testing Required
- User needs to build and test with 60fps camera
- Measure roundtrip latency (should be ~8 frames or better)
- Compare with v1.6.5 to verify improvement
- If still high, may need to address threading model

## Repository State
- Main branch: v1.6.5 
- Open PRs: #12 (README update), #13 (latency fix)
- Active feature branches: fix/update-readme-to-v165, fix/media-foundation-latency

## Next Steps
1. User to build and test PR #13
2. Verify compilation succeeds with the fixes
3. Measure latency with 60fps camera
4. If latency still high, consider removing threading:
   - Refactor to match reference's synchronous model
   - Direct ReadSample → NDI send in main thread
5. Once latency is acceptable, merge PR #13
6. Consider merging PR #12 (README update)
7. Check TODO.md for next priority items

## Quick Reference
- Current version in PR: 1.6.6
- Branch: fix/media-foundation-latency
- PR: #13
- Key fix: NDI clock_video=false + no sleep in capture
- Compilation fixes: version.h updated, CMakeLists.txt updated
