# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Media Foundation source file received and analyzed
- [x] Created abstract capture interface (capture_interface.h)
- [x] Refactored Media Foundation code into modular components
- [ ] Currently working on: Need to create capture device factory implementation
- [ ] Waiting for: User to review refactored code structure
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Code Refactoring - Media Foundation Complete
- Step: Completed MF refactoring, ready for factory implementation
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED

## Refactoring Progress

### Media Foundation Refactoring ✅ COMPLETE
Successfully refactored monolithic Media Foundation source into:

1. **Error Handling** (`mf_error_handling.h/cpp`)
   - HRESULT to string conversion
   - Error checking utilities
   - Device error detection
   - RAII wrappers for COM/MF initialization

2. **Format Conversion** (`mf_format_converter.h/cpp`)
   - YUY2 to UYVY conversion
   - NV12 to UYVY conversion
   - Generic format conversion dispatcher
   - Buffer size calculations

3. **Device Management** (`mf_capture_device.h/cpp`)
   - Device enumeration
   - Device lookup by name
   - Source reader creation
   - Configuration utilities

4. **Video Capture** (`mf_video_capture.h/cpp`)
   - Capture loop implementation
   - Format negotiation
   - Frame delivery via callbacks
   - Error recovery

5. **Main Interface** (`media_foundation_capture.h/cpp`)
   - Implements ICaptureDevice interface
   - Coordinates all MF components
   - Provides clean API for application

### Key Improvements Made:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Error Handling**: Centralized and consistent error management
- **Threading**: Capture runs in separate thread with proper synchronization
- **Callbacks**: Clean frame delivery mechanism via callbacks
- **RAII**: Proper resource management with RAII patterns
- **Modularity**: Easy to test individual components

## Next Steps
1. **Create CaptureDeviceFactory implementation** to instantiate capture devices
2. **Create common utilities** (frame_buffer.h/cpp, logger.h/cpp)
3. **Receive DeckLink source code** for similar refactoring
4. **Create NDI output wrapper**
5. **Build test application** to verify refactored code
6. **Update CMakeLists.txt** with new file structure

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Analyzed monolithic Media Foundation source code
2. ✅ Created abstract capture interface
3. ✅ Extracted error handling utilities
4. ✅ Extracted format conversion utilities
5. ✅ Extracted device enumeration/management
6. ✅ Extracted video capture logic
7. ✅ Created main MF capture implementation
8. ✅ Maintained all original functionality

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-11 09:07:00
- Action: Provided Media Foundation source code
- Result: Successfully refactored into modular components
- Next Required: Review refactored structure and provide feedback or DeckLink source

## Notes for Next Steps
- All Media Foundation functionality preserved in refactored code
- Ready to create factory implementation
- Need DeckLink source code for similar refactoring
- Consider creating unit tests for each component
- May need to adjust CMake build configuration
