# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: v1.6.1 compilation fixes complete
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test TRUE zero-copy performance
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Latency Optimization - DeckLink TRUE Zero-Copy
- Step: v1.6.1 implemented and fixed
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
- Version: 1.6.1 (TRUE zero-copy for UYVY)

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| DeckLink Zero Latency | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (100% direct) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Direct Frame Callback | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (100% direct) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Pre-allocated Buffers | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (8MB allocated) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Reduced Queue Size | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (bypassed) | ❌ | ❌ |
| TRUE Zero-Copy UYVY | ✅ v1.6.1 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## v1.6.1 Implementation Complete
**TRUE Zero-Copy for UYVY Format**:
- ✅ UYVY sent directly to NDI without ANY conversion
- ✅ NDI natively supports UYVY format
- ✅ Eliminated unnecessary UYVY→BGRA conversion
- ✅ Removed low-latency mode flag - always optimized
- ✅ Created DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md documenting low-latency focus
- ✅ Fixed COM interface usage (GetBytes on IDeckLinkVideoBuffer)

## Recent Fixes Applied
1. **v1.6.0 Compilation Fix**:
   - Added `metadata` field to CaptureStatistics
   - Fixed compilation errors

2. **v1.6.1 TRUE Zero-Copy**:
   - ProcessFrameZeroCopy now sends UYVY directly to NDI
   - No format conversion for DeckLink's native UYVY output
   - Should achieve same performance as Linux V4L2

3. **v1.6.1 COM Interface Fix**:
   - Fixed GetBytes() calls to use IDeckLinkVideoBuffer interface
   - Both callback and legacy paths now use proper COM pattern

## Performance Comparison
### v1.6.0 (Previous Test):
- Direct callback: 100% ✅
- Zero-copy frames: 0% ❌ (was converting UYVY→BGRA)
- Latency: ~33-50ms saved from queue bypass

### v1.6.1 Expected:
- Direct callback: 100% ✅
- Zero-copy frames: 100% ✅ (UYVY direct to NDI)
- Additional latency saved: ~5-10ms (no format conversion)
- Total improvement: ~40-60ms lower latency

## Version History
- v1.5.4: Color space fix
- v1.6.0: Queue bypass + direct callbacks (tested, working)
- v1.6.1: TRUE zero-copy for UYVY (implemented, compilation fixed)
- v1.7.0: (PLANNED) AVX2 optimization for non-UYVY formats

## User Action Required
1. **Build v1.6.1** with the fixed code
2. **Run with DeckLink device** 
3. **Check startup logs** for:
   - "Version 1.6.1 loaded"
   - "DeckLink Capture v1.6.1 - Zero-copy UYVY enabled"
   - "TRUE ZERO-COPY: UYVY direct to NDI"
4. **Monitor performance**:
   - Zero-copy frames should now be > 0
   - Zero-copy percentage should be 100%
5. **Measure latency** - should be significantly lower than v1.6.0
6. **Provide logs** showing zero-copy working

## Branch State
- Branch: `feature/decklink-latency-optimization`
- Version: 1.6.1 (IMPLEMENTED)
- Commits: 14
- Testing: NOT STARTED for v1.6.1
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
- PR: #11 OPEN

## Next Steps
1. ✅ v1.6.0 tested and working
2. ✅ v1.6.1 TRUE zero-copy implemented
3. ✅ v1.6.1 compilation fixes applied
4. ⏳ User testing of v1.6.1 required
5. ⏳ Latency measurements needed
6. ⏳ PR #11 merge after v1.6.1 testing

## Design Philosophy Documented
Created `docs/DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md` to ensure future development maintains focus on:
- Low latency as NON-NEGOTIABLE priority
- Modern hardware only (Intel N100+)
- Simplicity through specialization
- Zero-copy by default
- No compatibility modes that compromise performance

## GOAL AFTER TESTING
Once v1.6.1 is confirmed working with 100% zero-copy:
1. **Merge PR #11** - DeckLink now matches Linux V4L2 performance
2. **v1.7.0**: AVX2 optimization for formats that DO need conversion
3. **v1.8.0**: Multi-threaded pipeline if further optimization needed
