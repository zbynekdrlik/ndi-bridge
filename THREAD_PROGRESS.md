## Build Instructions
```bash
# Visual Studio with built-in CMake:
1. Open Visual Studio
2. File -> Open -> Folder (select project root)
3. Select x64-Debug or x64-Release configuration
4. Build -> Build All

# Output will be in:
out/build/x64-Debug/bin/ndi-bridge.exe
or
out/build/x64-Release/bin/ndi-bridge.exe

# Traditional CMake build:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build . --config Release
```

## Command-Line Options
- `-d, --device <n>`: Capture device name (default: first available)
- `-n, --ndi-name <n>`: NDI sender name (default: 'NDI Bridge')
- `-l, --list-devices`: List available capture devices
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose logging
- `--no-retry`: Disable automatic retry on errors
- `--retry-delay <ms>`: Delay between retries (default: 5000)
- `--max-retries <count>`: Maximum retry attempts (-1 for infinite)
- `-h, --help`: Show help message
- `--version`: Show version information

## Next Steps for User
1. **Build the project**:
   - Ensure NDI SDK is installed or available in deps/ndi/
   - Build using Visual Studio or CMake
   - Build in Release mode for best performance

2. **Test basic functionality**:
   - Run with `--list-devices` to verify device enumeration
   - Test capture with default device
   - Verify NDI output with NDI Studio Monitor

3. **Verify against original**:
   - Compare frame quality
   - Check CPU usage
   - Verify stability over time

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Initial project structure created
2. ✅ Media Foundation code refactored into modules
3. ✅ All components committed to repository
4. ✅ Deep code verification completed
5. ✅ Verification report created
6. ✅ PR updated with findings
