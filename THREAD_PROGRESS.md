# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Build error fix - CMakeLists.txt version mismatch
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test the build fix
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: **Build Fix** - Fixing version mismatch errors
- Step: PR #14 created and ready for testing
- Status: WAITING_FOR_BUILD_TEST
- Version: Fixed CMakeLists.txt version (no code version change)

## Build Fix Details
**Pull Request #14 - Fix build errors: version mismatch**
- ✅ Created feature branch: `fix/build-version-mismatch`
- ✅ Updated CMakeLists.txt version from 1.5.0 to 1.6.5
- ✅ Removed conflicting CMake version definitions
- ✅ PR created with detailed explanation

## Build Errors Fixed
1. **C2065 'NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION': undeclared identifier**
2. **C2065 'NDI_BRIDGE_BUILD_TYPE': undeclared identifier**
3. **C2065 'NDI_BRIDGE_PLATFORM': undeclared identifier**

## Root Cause Analysis
- CMakeLists.txt had version 1.5.0 while version.h had 1.6.5
- CMake was defining version macros that conflicted with version.h
- The macros main.cpp expected were already defined in version.h

## Testing Required
User needs to:
1. Pull the `fix/build-version-mismatch` branch
2. Clean and rebuild the project
3. Verify build succeeds without errors
4. Run the application to confirm version 1.6.5 is displayed

## Repository State
- Main branch: v1.6.5
- Open PRs: 
  - #12 (fix/update-readme-to-v165) - Documentation update
  - #14 (fix/build-version-mismatch) - Build error fix
- Active feature branches: 
  - fix/update-readme-to-v165
  - fix/build-version-mismatch
  - fix/media-foundation-latency

## Last User Action
- Date: 2025-07-17
- Issue: Reported build errors with undefined identifiers
- Action: Created fix branch and PR #14

## Next Steps
1. User to test the build fix from PR #14
2. If build succeeds, merge PR #14
3. Review and merge PR #12 (README update)
4. Check TODO.md for next priority items
5. Consider addressing alignment warnings (C4324)

## Notes
- Alignment warnings (C4324) are benign - structures are padded for performance
- These warnings don't affect functionality but could be addressed later if desired
