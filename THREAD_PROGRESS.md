# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Linux V4L2 compilation fixes (v2.0.0)
- [x] Waiting for: User to compile and test fixed v2.0.0 implementation
- [ ] Blocked by: Compilation errors FIXED - ready for testing

## Implementation Status
- Phase: **Linux V4L2 Latency Fix** - Compilation fixed, ready for testing
- Step: v2.0.0 compilation issues resolved
- Status: FIXED_READY_FOR_TESTING
- Version: 2.0.0

## Recent Fix Summary
**Header/Implementation Mismatch Resolved**:
- Added missing member declarations to v4l2_capture.h:
  - CaptureStats struct and getStats() method
  - stats_ member and stats_mutex_
  - buffer_type_ and dmabuf_supported_ members
  - trySetupDMABUF() method declaration
  - Compatibility member variables for constructor
  - Added <sys/mman.h> include for mlockall

## Linux V4L2 "Zero Compromise" Implementation
**v2.0.0 Features**:
- **ULTRA-LOW LATENCY APPLIANCE MODE**
- ALWAYS 3 buffers (absolute minimum)
- ALWAYS zero-copy for YUV formats
- ALWAYS single-threaded (no queues)
- ALWAYS real-time priority 80
- ALWAYS immediate polling (0ms)
- NO configuration options
- NO compromise on latency

## Testing Required
1. Compile on Linux:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ndi-bridge
   mkdir -p build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

2. Test with 60fps camera:
   ```bash
   sudo ./ndi-bridge -d /dev/video0 -n "Linux Test"
   ```

3. Verify:
   - [ ] Successful compilation
   - [ ] Version 2.0.0 logged on startup
   - [ ] Real-time priority active
   - [ ] Zero-copy path for UYVY/YUYV
   - [ ] Round-trip latency measurement
   - [ ] Target: 8 frames latency

## Repository State
- Main branch: v1.6.5
- Current branch: fix/linux-v4l2-latency (v2.0.0)
- Open PR: #15 (Linux latency fix)
- Windows latency: FIXED (8 frames) ✅
- Linux latency: TO BE TESTED (target 8 frames)

## Next Steps
1. User compiles fixed v2.0.0 code
2. Test latency with OBS latency tool
3. If successful (8 frames achieved):
   - Update PR #15
   - Merge to main
4. If not successful:
   - Analyze logs
   - Further optimizations needed

## Key Learnings from Windows Fix
1. **NDI clock_video=false** is CRITICAL
2. **No sleeps in capture loops**
3. **Media Foundation attributes** reduce buffering
4. **Single-threaded** can match multi-threaded performance

## Linux Implementation Strategy
- Applied all Windows learnings
- Hardcoded optimal settings
- Zero compromise on performance
- Treating as appliance, not application

## Quick Reference
- Current version: 2.0.0
- Branch: fix/linux-v4l2-latency
- PR: #15
- Compilation: FIXED ✅
- Testing: PENDING ⏳
