# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Logging improvements implemented
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test the changes
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Logging System Refactor
- Step: Implementation complete
- Status: TESTING_NEEDED

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| logger.h/cpp | ✅ v1.2.2 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| main.cpp logging | ✅ v1.2.2 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| app_controller logging | ✅ v1.2.2 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| ndi_sender logging | ✅ v1.2.2 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Changes Implemented in This Thread

### 1. Logger Format Simplified (v1.2.2)
- **Removed module names** from log format
- Changed from: `[module_name] [timestamp] message`
- Changed to: `[timestamp] message`
- Removed `Logger::initialize()` method completely
- Removed static `module_name_` member

### 2. Single Version Logging
- **Removed all `Logger::logVersion()` calls** from:
  - AppController constructor
  - NdiSender constructor
  - MediaFoundationCapture constructor
- **Kept only one version log** in main.cpp at startup
- Changed version message from "Script version X.Y.Z loaded" to "Version X.Y.Z loaded"

### 3. Fixed cout Usage
- Replaced direct `cout` usage in `listDevices()` with Logger calls
- Replaced "Available Devices:" cout with Logger in `selectDeviceInteractive()`
- All output now goes through the Logger for consistency

### 4. Version Bump
- Updated version from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2

## Files Modified
1. **src/common/logger.h** - Removed module name functionality
2. **src/common/logger.cpp** - Updated to new format
3. **src/common/version.h** - Bumped to v1.2.2
4. **src/main.cpp** - Removed Logger::initialize(), fixed cout usage
5. **src/common/app_controller.cpp** - Removed Logger::initialize() and logVersion()
6. **src/common/ndi_sender.cpp** - Removed Logger::initialize() and logVersion()
7. **src/windows/media_foundation/media_foundation_capture.cpp** - Removed Logger::initialize() and logVersion()

## Expected Test Results
After building and running, the logs should show:
1. Single version log at startup: `[2025-07-15 HH:MM:SS.mmm] Version 1.2.2 loaded`
2. No module names in any log entries
3. Consistent timestamp format throughout
4. All device listings using Logger instead of cout

## Next Steps for User
1. **Build the application** with the new changes
2. **Run and capture logs** showing:
   - Application startup with version log
   - Device enumeration/selection
   - Normal operation
3. **Verify**:
   - Only one version log appears at startup
   - No module names in log format
   - All output uses consistent format
   - No raw cout usage

## Branch Information
- Working branch: feature/consistent-logging  
- Base branch: main

## Last User Action

- Action: Requested to fulfill new goals (logging improvements)
- Result: Implementation complete, waiting for test
- Next Required: User to build and test changes
