# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Media Foundation latency optimization v1.6.7
- [x] Waiting for: User to test v1.6.7 (removed sleep in capture loop)
- [x] SUCCESS: Achieved 8 frames latency on Windows Media Foundation!

## Implementation Status
- Phase: **Latency Fix** - Media Foundation optimizations
- Step: v1.6.7 COMPLETE - Target achieved!
- Status: TESTED_AND_WORKING
- Version: 1.6.7

## Media Foundation Latency Fix - COMPLETE ✅
**v1.6.6 Results**:
- Reduced latency from 14 frames to 10 frames
- Improvements:
  - NDI clock_video=false (immediate delivery)
  - Removed 5ms sleep (initially)
  - Added MF low-latency attributes

**v1.6.7 Results**:
- ✅ Reduced latency from 10 frames to 8 frames!
- ✅ Removed remaining 5ms sleep in capture loop
- ✅ Now uses tight loop when no sample available
- ✅ TARGET ACHIEVED: Back to reference implementation performance

## Key Learnings from Media Foundation Fix
1. **NDI clock_video=false** is CRITICAL for low latency
2. **No sleeps in capture loops** - tight loops are essential
3. **Media Foundation attributes** help reduce internal buffering
4. **Threading still adds 1-2 frames** but acceptable for now

## Next Goal: Linux V4L2 Latency Fix
**Current Linux Performance**:
- v1.5.0: Multi-threaded pipeline with 12 frames latency
- Despite being "optimized", it's worse than Windows!
- Target: Reduce from 12 frames to 8 frames

**Suspected Issues in Linux Implementation**:
1. **Multi-threading overhead** (3 threads might be overkill)
2. **Frame queues** between threads add buffering
3. **Possible sleeps** in capture or processing loops
4. **NDI clock settings** might not be optimized
5. **V4L2 buffer count** might be too high

**Action Plan for Next Thread**:
1. Analyze v4l2_capture.cpp for sleep/delay patterns
2. Check NDI sender configuration (clock_video setting)
3. Review multi-threaded pipeline - might need simplification
4. Examine frame queue depths and buffering
5. Consider single-threaded option like Media Foundation

## Repository State
- Main branch: v1.6.5
- Open PRs: #12 (README update), #13 (latency fix)
- Current branch: fix/media-foundation-latency (v1.6.7)
- Windows latency: FIXED (8 frames) ✅
- Linux latency: TO BE FIXED (12 frames) ❌

## Next Steps
1. Update PR #13 with v1.6.7 success
2. Merge PR #13 to main
3. Create new branch: fix/linux-v4l2-latency
4. Apply learnings from Windows to Linux implementation

## Quick Reference
- Current version: 1.6.7
- Branch: fix/media-foundation-latency
- PR: #13
- Windows latency: 8 frames ✅
- Linux latency: 12 frames (needs fixing)
