## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: DeckLink latency optimizations implemented
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test optimizations
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Latency Optimization - DeckLink Implementation
- Step: Implementation complete, awaiting testing
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
- Version: 1.6.0

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| DeckLink Zero Latency | ✅ v1.6.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Direct Frame Callback | ✅ v1.6.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Pre-allocated Buffers | ✅ v1.6.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Reduced Queue Size | ✅ v1.6.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Issue Description
DeckLink implementation has much worse latency than Linux V4L2 implementation. Need to apply the excellent techniques from Linux implementation to DeckLink.

## Analysis Results
### Linux V4L2 Low-Latency Techniques:
1. **Zero-copy path**: YUYV format passed directly without conversion
2. **Memory-mapped buffers**: Direct DMA access with V4L2_MEMORY_MMAP
3. **Non-blocking I/O**: O_NONBLOCK with poll() using 1-5ms timeout
4. **Pre-allocated buffers**: Conversion buffers allocated ahead of time
5. **Multi-threaded pipeline**: 3 threads with CPU affinity
6. **Lock-free queues**: Minimal locking for thread communication
7. **Immediate buffer requeuing**: Buffers requeued ASAP
8. **Hardware timestamps**: V4L2_BUF_FLAG_TIMESTAMP_MONOTONIC

### DeckLink Latency Issues Found:
1. **Frame queue buffering**: MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=3 adds 50ms latency at 60fps
2. **Synchronous processing**: No pipeline parallelism
3. **COM interface overhead**: Windows COM adds overhead
4. **No zero-copy path**: Always copies frame data
5. **No pre-allocation**: Allocates on-demand

## Implementation Complete (v1.6.0)
1. ✅ **Reduced frame queue size** from 3 to 1 (saves ~33ms at 60fps)
2. ✅ **Zero-copy path** for UYVY format - passes frames directly
3. ✅ **Pre-allocated buffers** for BGRA conversion
4. ✅ **Direct callback mode** - bypasses queue entirely
5. ✅ **Performance tracking** - monitors zero-copy usage
6. ✅ **Low-latency mode flag** - default ON

## Version History
- v1.5.4: Color space fix complete (previous issue)
- v1.6.0: DeckLink latency optimization IMPLEMENTED

## User Action Required
1. **Build the application** with the new changes
2. **Run with DeckLink device** 
3. **Check startup logs** for:
   - "DeckLink Capture v1.6.0 - Low-latency optimizations enabled"
   - "Low latency mode: ON"
4. **Monitor performance**:
   - Check for "Using zero-copy path for UYVY format" if applicable
   - Note final statistics showing zero-copy percentage
5. **Measure latency** and compare with previous version
6. **Provide logs** showing all the above

## Branch State
- Branch: `feature/decklink-latency-optimization`
- Version: 1.6.0 (IMPLEMENTED)
- Commits: 5
- Testing: NOT STARTED
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
- PR: #11 CREATED

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Implementation complete
2. ⏳ User testing required
3. ⏳ Latency measurements needed
4. ⏳ Performance verification
5. ⏳ PR #11 merge after testing

## Future Optimizations (if needed)
- Multi-threaded pipeline (like V4L2's 3-thread model)
- Lock-free queues for thread communication
- Hardware timestamp support
- Direct DMA access if possible
