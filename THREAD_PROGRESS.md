## Critical Information for Next Thread

### What We Know:
- v1.1.3 compiles successfully
- All documentation is current
- User reports "some parts not working correctly"
- Testing has not been completed

### What We Need:
1. **Specific error details**
   - Which commands fail?
   - What error messages appear?
   - Which features work/don't work?

2. **Test results from each component**
   - Media Foundation device listing
   - DeckLink device listing
   - Capture functionality
   - NDI streaming

3. **Debug logs**
   - Verbose output from failed operations
   - System configuration details
   - SDK versions

### Priority Actions:
1. Get detailed bug reports from user
2. Run systematic tests of all features
3. Fix identified issues
4. Update version if needed (1.1.4)
5. Re-test until stable
6. Then proceed with merge

## Technical Debt Identified
1. **No automated tests** - All testing is manual
2. **DeckLinkCaptureDevice.cpp too large** (677 lines) - Goal 12
3. **Two ICaptureDevice interfaces** - Should be consolidated
4. **Linux Support** - Framework exists but not implemented

## Current Code State Summary
- **Compilation successful** ✅
- **Documentation complete** ✅
- **Runtime issues reported** ❌
- **Testing incomplete** ❌
- **NOT ready for merge** - needs fixing

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-15 10:10:00
- Action: Reported that some parts are not working correctly in v1.1.3
- Result: Set Goal 11 for testing and fixing in next thread
- Next Required: Detailed testing and bug fixing in new thread
