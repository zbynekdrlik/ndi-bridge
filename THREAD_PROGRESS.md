## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Color Space Detection | ✅ v1.5.4 | ✅ | ✅ | N/A |
| BT.709/601 Auto-detect | ✅ v1.5.4 | ✅ | ✅ | N/A |

## Issue Description
User reported that Decklink video capture has incorrect/faded colors compared to OBS. User correctly pointed out that OBS can auto-detect color parameters, so ndi-bridge should too.

## Solution Implemented (v4 - SDK Compatibility) - VERIFIED WORKING
1. **SDK Compatibility Fix**: Added dummy defines for missing color detection enums in older SDKs
2. **Header Guard Fix**: Added traditional include guards to prevent redefinition warnings
3. **Maintained Functionality**: Color detection still works on newer SDKs, falls back gracefully on older ones
4. **Color Detection**: Properly detects BT.709/601 and Limited/Full range like OBS

## Version History
- v1.5.1: Initial fix with range auto-detection (had issues)
- v1.5.2: Forced limited range YUV (worked but hardcoded)
- v1.5.3: Proper detection from Decklink API (like OBS)
- v1.5.4: Fixed SDK compatibility for older versions (FINAL)

## Test Results (PASSED)
- Build: ✅ Compiles without errors
- SDK Compatibility: ✅ Works with older DeckLink SDK
- Color Detection: ✅ Properly detects Rec.709 and Limited range
- Color Output: ✅ **Colors match OBS exactly**
- Performance: ✅ Stable 56-57 fps for 60fps input

## User Confirmation
- Date/Time: 2025-07-16 20:12
- Test Result: "it is correct"
- Colors match OBS: CONFIRMED
- Ready for merge: YES

## Final Test Log
