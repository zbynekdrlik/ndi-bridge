# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: v1.6.2 callback initialization fix implemented
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test v1.6.2 with callback fix
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Latency Optimization - DeckLink TRUE Zero-Copy
- Step: v1.6.2 bug fix for callback initialization
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
- Version: 1.6.2 (callback initialization order fix)

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| DeckLink Zero Latency | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (100% direct) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Direct Frame Callback | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (100% direct) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Pre-allocated Buffers | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (8MB allocated) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Reduced Queue Size | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (bypassed) | ❌ | ❌ |
| TRUE Zero-Copy UYVY | ✅ v1.6.1 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Callback Init Fix | ✅ v1.6.2 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## v1.6.2 Bug Fix Applied
**Fixed DeckLink Frame Callback Issue**:
- ✅ Initialize device BEFORE setting frame callback
- ✅ Frame callback now set on properly initialized device
- ✅ This should fix "No frames received" error
- ✅ Callback was being set before device initialization

## Recent Issues Found & Fixed
1. **v1.6.1 Frame Delivery Issue**:
   - Logs showed signal detected but 0 frames received
   - 293 frames dropped in 5 seconds
   - VideoInputFrameArrived callback wasn't being invoked

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Frame callback was being set BEFORE device initialization
   - DeckLink requires device to be initialized before callbacks
   - Fixed by reordering: Initialize() then SetFrameCallback()

## Performance Comparison
### v1.6.0 (Previous Test):
- Direct callback: 100% ✅
- Zero-copy frames: 0% ❌ (was converting UYVY→BGRA)
- Latency: ~33-50ms saved from queue bypass

### v1.6.1 Expected:
- Direct callback: 100% ✅
- Zero-copy frames: 100% ✅ (UYVY direct to NDI)
- Additional latency saved: ~5-10ms (no format conversion)
- Total improvement: ~40-60ms lower latency

### v1.6.2 Fixed:
- Callback initialization order corrected
- Should now receive frames properly
- Same performance as v1.6.1 once working

## Version History
- v1.5.4: Color space fix
- v1.6.0: Queue bypass + direct callbacks (tested, working)
- v1.6.1: TRUE zero-copy for UYVY (callback not invoked)
- v1.6.2: Fixed callback initialization order

## User Action Required
1. **Build v1.6.2** with the callback fix
2. **Run with DeckLink device** 
3. **Check startup logs** for:
   - "Version 1.6.2 loaded"
   - "DeckLink Capture v1.6.1" (internal version still shows 1.6.1)
   - "TRUE ZERO-COPY: UYVY direct to NDI" when frames arrive
4. **Monitor for frames**:
   - Should see frames being received now
   - Zero-copy frames counter should increment
   - No more "No frames received" errors
5. **Provide logs** showing frames are being processed

## Branch State
- Branch: `feature/decklink-latency-optimization`
- Version: 1.6.2 (IMPLEMENTED)
- Commits: 16
- Testing: NOT STARTED for v1.6.2
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
- PR: #11 OPEN

## Next Steps
1. ✅ v1.6.0 tested and working (queue bypass)
2. ✅ v1.6.1 TRUE zero-copy implemented
3. ✅ v1.6.1 compilation fixes applied
4. ✅ v1.6.2 callback initialization fix applied
5. ⏳ User testing of v1.6.2 required
6. ⏳ Latency measurements needed
7. ⏳ PR #11 merge after v1.6.2 testing

## Technical Details
The issue was in `DeckLinkCapture::startCapture()`:
- Before: SetFrameCallback() → Initialize() → StartCapture()
- After: Initialize() → SetFrameCallback() → StartCapture()

This ensures the DeckLink device is properly initialized before setting up callbacks, which is required by the DeckLink SDK.

## GOAL AFTER TESTING
Once v1.6.2 is confirmed working with 100% zero-copy:
1. **Merge PR #11** - DeckLink now matches Linux V4L2 performance
2. **v1.7.0**: AVX2 optimization for formats that DO need conversion
3. **v1.8.0**: Multi-threaded pipeline if further optimization needed
