## Issue Description
User reported that Decklink video capture has incorrect/faded colors compared to OBS. User correctly pointed out that OBS can auto-detect color parameters, so ndi-bridge should too.

## Solution Implemented (v4 - SDK Compatibility)
1. **SDK Compatibility Fix**: Added dummy defines for missing color detection enums in older SDKs
2. **Header Guard Fix**: Added traditional include guards to prevent redefinition warnings
3. **Maintained Functionality**: Color detection still works on newer SDKs, falls back gracefully on older ones

## Version History
- v1.5.1: Initial fix with range auto-detection (had issues)
- v1.5.2: Forced limited range YUV (worked but hardcoded)
- v1.5.3: Proper detection from Decklink API (like OBS)
- v1.5.4: Fixed SDK compatibility for older versions

## Technical Implementation
- Added dummy defines for `bmdDetectedVideoInputColorspaceRec601/709` and `bmdDetectedVideoInputRangeFull` when not available
- These dummy values (0x00000000) won't match any real flags, so code falls back to resolution-based detection
- Added traditional header guards to version.h to prevent multiple inclusion warnings
- SDK detection message now indicates when using fallback mode

## Changes Made (v1.5.4)
- Updated `DeckLinkFormatManager.cpp` with SDK compatibility defines
- Fixed `version.h` with proper include guards
- Incremented version to 1.5.4

## Build Errors Fixed
1. **Undeclared identifiers**: `bmdDetectedVideoInputColorspaceRec601`, `bmdDetectedVideoInputColorspaceRec709`, `bmdDetectedVideoInputRangeFull`
2. **Macro redefinition**: `NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION_PATCH` and `NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION_STRING`
3. **Structure padding warnings**: These are just warnings and don't affect functionality

## Testing Required
User needs to:
1. Pull latest changes from fix/decklink-color-space branch
2. Clean and rebuild the project
3. Verify build completes without errors
4. Test with Decklink capture device
5. Verify version shows as 1.5.4 in logs
6. Check logs for color detection (will show "SDK color detection not available" on older SDKs)
7. Compare colors with OBS output

## Expected Log Output (Older SDK)
```
[DeckLink] Using Rec.709 for HD content (SDK color detection not available)
[DeckLink] Using Limited/SMPTE range (16-235) - standard for broadcast
```

## Expected Log Output (Newer SDK)
```
[DeckLink] Detected color space: Rec.709 (HD)
[DeckLink] Detected color range: Limited/SMPTE (16-235)
```

## Last Actions
- Date/Time: 2025-07-16 (current session)
- Action: Fixed SDK compatibility issues for older DeckLink versions
- Result: v1.5.4 ready for testing
- Next Required: User to rebuild and test

## Branch State
- Branch: `fix/decklink-color-space`
- Version: 1.5.4
- Commits: 14 total
- Ready for testing

## Next Steps

2. Verify build completes without errors
3. Test color detection with DeckLink device
4. Verify colors match OBS
5. If successful, merge PR #10
