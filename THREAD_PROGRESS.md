# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] All compilation errors fixed in v1.0.7
- [x] Ready for testing
- [ ] Currently working on: Goal 8 planning only
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test v1.0.7
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## GOAL 8: DeckLink Integration (PLANNING ONLY)
### Objective: Add Blackmagic DeckLink capture card support

### Status: PLANNING PHASE - NO IMPLEMENTATION YET

### Planned Architecture:
1. **DeckLink Capture Implementation**
   - Create `src/windows/decklink/decklink_capture.h/cpp`
   - Implement ICaptureDevice interface for DeckLink
   - Handle DeckLink SDK initialization
   - Support device enumeration
   - Implement frame capture with UYVY output

2. **DeckLink SDK Integration**
   - Add DeckLink SDK detection to CMakeLists.txt
   - Make DeckLink support optional (USE_DECKLINK flag)
   - Handle SDK path variations
   - Add necessary COM interfaces

3. **Multi-Capture Support**
   - Modify main.cpp to support device type selection
   - Add `--capture-type` flag (mf/decklink/auto)
   - Implement auto-detection logic
   - Update device listing to show both types

4. **DeckLink-Specific Features**
   - Support for professional formats (SDI, HDMI)
   - Handle interlaced video properly
   - Support for embedded audio
   - Timecode support (if needed)

### Documentation Created:
- ✅ `docs/architecture/capture-devices.md` - Architecture overview
- ✅ `docs/decklink-setup.md` - Setup and usage guide
- ✅ Updated `README.md` with roadmap

### Implementation NOT Started
- No code files created yet
- Planning phase only
- Will implement after v1.0.7 testing

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Goal 8 - DeckLink Integration Planning
- Step: Planning Only
- Status: GOAL_SET_PLANNING_ONLY
- Version: 1.0.7 (will bump to 1.1.0 when DeckLink implemented)

## All Features Currently Working (v1.0.7):
1. ✅ **Interactive device selection menu**
2. ✅ **Command-line positional parameters**
3. ✅ **Interactive NDI name input**
4. ✅ **Wait for Enter in CLI mode**
5. ✅ **Device re-enumeration**
6. ✅ **All compilation errors fixed**

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Compiled | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Runtime Tested |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Media Foundation | ✅ v1.0.7 | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | 🔄 |
| DeckLink | ❌ Planning | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| NDI Sender | ✅ v1.0.1 | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | 🔄 |
| App Controller | ✅ v1.0.0 | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | 🔄 |

## Previous Goals Completed:
### ✅ GOAL 1: Initial Project Structure
### ✅ GOAL 2: Media Foundation Refactoring
### ✅ GOAL 3: Integration Components (v1.0.3)
### ✅ GOAL 4: NDI SDK Configuration (v1.0.4)
### ✅ GOAL 5: Feature Restoration (v1.0.5)
### ✅ GOAL 6: Fix Compilation Errors (v1.0.6)
### ✅ GOAL 7: Fix Windows Macro Conflicts (v1.0.7)
### 📋 GOAL 8: DeckLink Integration (PLANNING ONLY)

## DeckLink Requirements (For Future Implementation)
- **DeckLink SDK**: Version 12.0 or later
- **Hardware**: Any Blackmagic DeckLink card
- **OS**: Windows 10/11 (initially)
- **Driver**: Desktop Video driver installed

## Notes
- Goal 8 is set but NO implementation started
- Only planning documents created
- v1.0.7 needs testing before proceeding with DeckLink
- DeckLink will be optional - controlled by USE_DECKLINK CMake flag
- Version will jump to 1.1.0 when DeckLink support is implemented

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-14 21:27:00
- Action: Reminded to only set goal, not implement
- Result: Removed premature implementation, kept only planning
- Next Required: Test v1.0.7 before DeckLink implementation
