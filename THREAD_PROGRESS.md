## Changes Summary (v1.3.5 - CRITICAL BUG FIX)

### üö® CRITICAL FIX ‚úÖ
1. **AVX2 Pixel Processing Bug** ‚úÖ
   - Was only processing first 8 pixels out of 16
   - Would have caused half the image to be corrupted/missing
   - Fixed processYUV16_AVX2() to process all 16 pixels
   - Now outputs full 128 bytes (16 BGRA pixels) instead of 64

2. **Version Updated** ‚úÖ
   - Updated to v1.3.5 across all files
   - Fixed AVX2 header version comment (was still 1.3.3)

### Impact of the Bug (if not fixed)
- **Visual Artifacts**: Half the pixels would be unprocessed
- **Performance Issues**: Severe frame corruption
- **Memory Issues**: Potential buffer underrun/overrun
- **User Experience**: Completely unusable video output

### v1.3.4 Features (Previous Version)
1. **AVX2 Runtime Logging** ‚úÖ
2. **Version Comment Fix** ‚úÖ
3. **Enhanced Logging** ‚úÖ

### v1.3.3 Features (Critical Fixes)
1. **Buffer Overflow in AVX2** (CRITICAL SECURITY FIX)
2. **Non-existent AVX2 Function** (fixed)
3. **Vector Size Corrections** (fixed)

### Files Modified (v1.3.5)
1. src/linux/v4l2/v4l2_format_converter_avx2.h (pixel processing fix) ‚úÖ
2. src/common/version.h (v1.3.5) ‚úÖ
3. CMakeLists.txt (v1.3.5) ‚úÖ

## Intel N100 Video Encoding Note
**Intel N100 Hardware Encoding Capabilities:**
- Supports Intel Quick Sync Video (QSV)
- H.264/AVC encoding up to 4K 60fps
- H.265/HEVC encoding up to 4K 60fps
- AV1 decoding only (no encoding)
- VP9 decoding only (no encoding)

**Not Currently Used in NDI Bridge:**
- NDI uses its own proprietary codec (NDI HX uses H.264/H.265)
- This app sends raw BGRA frames to NDI SDK
- NDI SDK handles all compression internally
- Future enhancement could use QSV for pre-compression if NDI HX is targeted

## PR Status
**PR #8**: [feat: Add Linux USB capture card support (V4L2)](https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/ndi-bridge/pull/8)
- Status: Open
- Files changed: 15
- Additions: +2200 (approximate)
- Deletions: -91
- Ready for: Final testing with all improvements and CRITICAL FIX

## Testing Required
- [ ] Build on Linux x64 (Ubuntu 20.04+) with AVX2 support
- [ ] Verify AVX2 detection logging on Intel N100
- [ ] Verify AVX2 runtime logging when converting frames
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Verify all pixels are processed (no half-image corruption)**
- [ ] Test all format conversions (YUYV, UYVY, NV12)
- [ ] Verify no crashes/memory corruption
- [ ] Test on non-Intel CPU (AMD) to verify CPU detection
- [ ] Test device enumeration
- [ ] Test with USB webcam
- [ ] Test with HDMI capture card (NZXT or similar)
- [ ] Verify format conversion quality
- [ ] Check memory usage and leaks (valgrind)
- [ ] Performance testing (CPU usage < 10% target)
- [ ] Measure AVX2 performance improvement
- [ ] Error handling (device disconnect/reconnect)
- [ ] Long-running stability test
- [ ] Verify version 1.3.5 logged on startup

## Performance Targets (Intel N100)
- 1080p60 capture: < 10% CPU usage
- Frame latency: < 16ms
- Zero frame drops under normal load
- Memory usage: < 200MB
- Format conversion: < 5ms per frame

## Known Limitations
- MJPEG decompression not implemented (requires libjpeg)
- No DeckLink support on Linux (Windows only)
- Focus on USB capture devices only
- No hardware encoding used (NDI handles compression)

## Next Steps
1. User to test Linux build on Intel N100 system
2. **CRITICAL: Verify no image corruption with AVX2 fix**
3. Verify AVX2 detection and runtime logging
4. Confirm no crashes with all fixes applied
5. Test all format conversions work correctly
6. Benchmark AVX2 performance improvements
7. Test on different CPU architectures
8. Fix any compilation issues
9. Test with actual hardware
10. Address feedback and bugs
11. Merge PR after successful testing

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-16
- Action: Requested deep verification and found critical bug
- Result: Fixed AVX2 pixel processing bug, v1.3.5
- Next Required: Build and test on Linux system with Intel N100

## Critical Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT MERGE WITHOUT TESTING** - The AVX2 pixel processing bug was CRITICAL and would have made the video output completely unusable with half the pixels missing.

‚úÖ **CRITICAL FIX APPLIED** - The AVX2 implementation now correctly processes all 16 pixels instead of just 8. This was a severe bug that would have caused major visual artifacts.

üö® **TESTING PRIORITY** - When testing, pay special attention to:
1. Full image integrity (no missing pixels)
2. Correct color conversion across entire frame
3. Performance with AVX2 enabled vs disabled
4. Memory access patterns (use valgrind)
