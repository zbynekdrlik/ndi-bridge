# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Linux V4L2 pure busy-wait implementation (v2.1.2)
- [x] Waiting for: User to test v2.1.2 with PURE BUSY-WAIT
- [ ] Blocked by: Need to verify if 60 FPS and 8 frames latency achieved

## Implementation Status
- Phase: **Linux V4L2 Extreme Latency Fix** - v2.1.2 ready
- Step: Pure busy-wait implemented for maximum FPS
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED (pure busy-wait, no poll)
- Version: 2.1.2 (pure busy-wait implementation)

## v2.1.2 Pure Busy-Wait Details
**Problem Analysis**:
- Poll with any timeout disrupts frame capture timing
- Thread yield causes us to miss frames
- At 60fps, we need to check for frames constantly

**v2.1.2 Implementation**:
1. ‚úÖ PURE BUSY-WAIT - No poll() at all
2. ‚úÖ Constant VIDIOC_DQBUF attempts
3. ‚úÖ EAGAIN counter for debugging
4. ‚úÖ 100% CPU usage expected on core 3
5. ‚úÖ All v2.1.0 extreme features active:
   - 2 buffers (absolute minimum)
   - CPU affinity to core 3
   - RT priority 90
   - Memory locked with MCL_ONFAULT

## Quick Test Instructions
```bash
# Pull the latest fix and test:
cd ~/ndi-test/ndi-bridge
git pull
./test-n100.sh
```

## Previous Test Results Summary
- v2.1.0 (busy-wait): Implementation bug - still used 3 buffers
- v2.1.0 fix1 (1ms poll): FPS dropped to 23-29
- v2.1.1 (0ms poll + yield): FPS still 16-28
- v2.1.2 (pure busy-wait): TESTING NOW

## Expected with v2.1.2
- 60 FPS stable capture ‚úÖ
- 100% CPU usage on core 3 (normal)
- 2 buffers active
- RT priority 90
- No poll overhead
- Target: 8 frames latency

## Linux V4L2 "EXTREME" Implementation
**v2.1.2 Features**:
- ALWAYS 2 buffers (EXTREME minimum)
- ALWAYS pure busy-wait (no poll)
- ALWAYS CPU affinity (core 3)
- ALWAYS RT priority 90 (maximum)
- ALWAYS memory locked
- NO compromise on latency

## Repository State
- Main branch: v1.6.5
- Current branch: fix/linux-v4l2-latency (v2.1.2)
- Latest commit: Pure busy-wait implementation
- Open PR: #15 (Linux latency fix)
- Windows latency: FIXED (8 frames) ‚úÖ
- Linux latency: TESTING v2.1.2 üéØ

## Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE**: User runs test-n100.sh with v2.1.2
2. Verify 60 FPS in logs (should see "Actual FPS: ~60")
3. Check CPU usage on core 3 (should be 100%)
4. Measure latency to see if we hit 8 frames
5. If successful:
   - Update PR #15 with v2.1.2 results
   - Merge to main
6. If still issues:
   - Investigate USB/driver bottlenecks
   - Consider kernel bypass approach

## Key Success Metrics
- FPS: 60 (stable, logged every 60 frames)
- Latency: 8 frames or less
- CPU: 100% on core 3 (expected)
- No frame drops
- Smooth capture

## Polling Strategy Evolution
- v2.0.0: 0ms poll (original)
- v2.1.0: Pure busy-wait (had implementation bug)
- v2.1.0 fix1: 1ms poll (FPS drop to 23-29)
- v2.1.1: Non-blocking poll + yield (FPS 16-28)
- v2.1.2: PURE BUSY-WAIT - no poll() ‚Üê CURRENT

## Technical Note
Pure busy-wait means the capture thread continuously calls ioctl(VIDIOC_DQBUF) in a tight loop. When no frame is ready, it returns EAGAIN and we immediately try again. This uses 100% CPU but ensures we never miss a frame.
