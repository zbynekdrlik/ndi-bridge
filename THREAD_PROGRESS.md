# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Logging implementation complete but has issues
- [ ] Waiting for: Next thread to implement improvements
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Logging System Update
- Step: Implementation complete with identified issues
- Status: TESTING_COMPLETE

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| logger.h/cpp | ✅ v1.2.1 | ✅ Compiles | ✅ Tested | ❌ Has issues |
| main.cpp logging | ✅ v1.2.1 | ✅ Compiles | ✅ Tested | ✅ |
| app_controller logging | ✅ v1.2.1 | ✅ Fixed version | ✅ Tested | ❌ Module name wrong |
| ndi_sender logging | ✅ v1.2.1 | ✅ Updated | ✅ Tested | ❌ Module name wrong |
| media_foundation logging | ✅ v1.2.1 | ✅ Fixed declaration | ✅ Tested | ❌ Module name wrong |

## Final Test Results

User ran complete test showing logging works but has issues:

### Issues Found:
1. **Module Name Confusion**: Logger::initialize() overwrites global module name
   - Example: `[MFVideoCapture]` showing for AppController messages
   - Root cause: Module name is static/global, not per-instance

2. **Multiple Version Logs**: Each component logs "Script version 1.2.1 loaded"
   - MediaFoundation logs version
   - AppController logs version  
   - NdiSender logs version
   - Should only log once at startup

3. **Device Enumeration Duplicated**: Being logged multiple times
   - MFVideoCapture logs devices
   - NdiSender logs devices twice

4. **Raw cout Usage**: "Available Devices:" still using cout directly

### Working Correctly:
- Timestamp format working perfectly
- Log levels working
- Main application startup logging correctly
- Compilation successful

## Completed Work Summary

### Issues Fixed in This Thread:
1. **Compilation Errors**: 
   - Fixed Windows macro conflicts (ERROR, LOG_*) by using LVL_* enum names
   - Fixed localtime security warning with localtime_s on Windows
   - Removed Logger usage before initialization in parseArgs()
   - Fixed missing wideToUtf8 declaration in mf_capture_device.h

2. **Version Management**:
   - Fixed hardcoded versions in AppController (was 1.0.3)
   - Fixed hardcoded versions in NdiSender (was 1.0.2)
   - All components now use NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION from version.h

3. **Logging Implementation**:
   - Created new Logger class with format: `[module_name] [timestamp] message`
   - Updated all components to use new Logger
   - Added timestamps with milliseconds
   - Implemented log levels: LVL_INFO, LVL_WARNING, LVL_ERROR, LVL_DEBUG

### Version
- Bumped from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1

## Next Thread Goals (CONFIRMED)

1. **Remove Module Names from Log Format**:
   - Change from: `[module_name] [timestamp] message`
   - Change to: `[timestamp] message`
   - Reasoning: Module names are not helpful in compiled exe
   - Fixes the module name confusion issue

2. **Single Version Source**:
   - Remove Logger::logVersion() calls from all components
   - Only log version once at main() startup
   - Remove "Script version" terminology (not a script)

3. **Fix Remaining cout Usage**:
   - "Available Devices:" list
   - Any other direct cout/cerr usage

## Handoff Notes for Next Thread

### Technical Details:
- Logger class uses static module_name_ which causes confusion
- Need to either remove module names or make Logger instance-based
- Decision made: Remove module names entirely

### Files to Modify:
1. logger.h/cpp - Remove module_name_ and update format
2. All components - Remove Logger::initialize() calls
3. All components - Remove Logger::logVersion() calls
4. main.cpp - Keep only one version log at startup
5. Fix remaining cout usage in device selection

### Test After Changes:
- Verify single version log at startup
- Verify consistent timestamp format
- Verify no module name confusion
- Verify all output uses Logger
