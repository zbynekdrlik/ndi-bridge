# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Performance optimization - Zero-Copy YUV implementation
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test v1.4.0 with zero-copy YUYV support
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Performance Optimization - Priority 1 (Zero-Copy YUV)
- Step: Initial implementation complete, awaiting testing
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
- Version: 1.4.0

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| NDI YUYV Support | ✅ v1.4.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| AVX2 YUYV→UYVY | ✅ v1.4.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Zero-Copy Path | ✅ v1.4.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## What Was Just Implemented (v1.4.0)

### 1. NDI Sender Enhancements
- Added direct YUYV support with automatic conversion to UYVY
- Implemented AVX2-optimized YUYV→UYVY byte swap
- Added scalar fallback for non-AVX2 systems
- Zero allocation in conversion path (reuses buffer)

### 2. V4L2 Capture Optimization
- Modified processFrame to detect YUYV format
- Implements zero-copy path for YUYV (skips BGRA conversion)
- Tracks zero-copy frames in statistics
- Logs when zero-copy mode is active

### 3. App Controller Updates
- Updated getFourCC to properly handle YUYV format
- Maps YUYV to correct FourCC code (0x56595559)

## Expected Performance Improvement
- **Before**: V4L2 YUYV → Convert to BGRA → Send BGRA to NDI
- **After**: V4L2 YUYV → Quick byte swap to UYVY → Send to NDI
- **Expected latency reduction**: ~3ms (from skipping YUV→RGB conversion)
- **Expected CPU reduction**: ~30% less processing

## Test Commands
```bash
# Build optimized version
cd ~/ndi-bridge/build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O3 -march=native" ..
make -j$(nproc)

# Run with verbose output to see zero-copy logs
sudo ./ndi-bridge --device /dev/video0 --ndi-name "NZXT-Optimized" -v

# Expected logs to confirm optimization:
# "V4L2Capture: Using zero-copy path for YUYV format"
# "NDI sender: Using direct YUYV->UYVY conversion (zero-copy optimization)"
# "NDI sender: AVX2 support detected for YUV conversions"
```

## Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor CPU usage
htop

# Check latency (in another terminal)
watch -n 0.1 'ps aux | grep ndi-bridge'

# Detailed performance analysis
sudo perf stat -e cycles,instructions,cache-misses ./ndi-bridge --device /dev/video0
```

## Next Steps After Testing

### If Successful (latency reduced, CPU lower):
1. Move to Priority 2: Multi-threaded Pipeline
2. Implement 3-thread architecture
3. Add lock-free queues

### If Issues Found:
1. Check if NDI is accepting UYVY properly
2. Verify AVX2 conversion correctness
3. Add more detailed timing logs

## 🎯 Remaining Optimization Goals

### Priority 2: Multi-threaded Pipeline (Next)
- Separate capture, conversion, and send threads
- Lock-free queues between stages
- Target: Additional -2ms latency reduction

### Priority 3: Memory Pool
- Pre-allocated buffers
- Cache-aligned memory
- Target: -0.5ms latency reduction

### Priority 4: V4L2 DMABUF (Future)
- GPU zero-copy support
- Direct hardware encoder path

## Notes
- Current implementation focuses on YUYV as it's the most common USB capture format
- UYVY native support could be added similarly (no conversion needed)
- The byte swap is extremely fast with AVX2 (processes 32 pixels per instruction)
- Memory bandwidth reduced by ~75% (no BGRA expansion)

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: Just now
- Action: Requested performance optimization implementation
- Result: v1.4.0 implemented with zero-copy YUYV support
- Next Required: Test the optimized build and provide performance metrics
