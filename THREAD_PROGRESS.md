# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Updated all components to use new Logger
- [ ] Waiting for: User to rebuild and test the complete logging implementation
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Logging System Update
- Step: All components updated, ready for full testing
- Status: TESTING_STARTED

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| logger.h/cpp | ✅ v1.2.1 | ✅ Compiles | ❌ | ❌ |
| main.cpp logging | ✅ v1.2.1 | ✅ Compiles | ❌ | ❌ |
| app_controller logging | ✅ v1.2.1 | ✅ Fixed version | ❌ | ❌ |
| ndi_sender logging | ✅ v1.2.1 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| media_foundation logging | ✅ v1.2.1 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Issues Fixed
1. **Compilation Error**: Removed Logger calls from parseArgs() function
   - Logger was being used before initialization
   - Reverted to std::cerr for error messages in parseArgs()
   
2. **Security Warning**: Fixed localtime warning on Windows
   - Now uses localtime_s on Windows for thread safety
   - Uses localtime on other platforms

3. **Windows Macro Conflict (First Attempt)**: Fixed ERROR enum value conflict
   - ERROR is defined as a macro in Windows headers
   - Renamed enum values to LOG_INFO, LOG_WARNING, LOG_ERROR, LOG_DEBUG
   - Updated all references in logger.cpp

4. **Windows Macro Conflict (Second Fix)**: LOG_* names still conflicted
   - LOG_INFO, LOG_WARNING, LOG_ERROR, LOG_DEBUG also conflict with Windows macros
   - Renamed enum values to LVL_INFO, LVL_WARNING, LVL_ERROR, LVL_DEBUG
   - Updated all references in logger.cpp
   - This successfully avoided all Windows macro conflicts

5. **Version Issues**: Fixed hardcoded versions
   - AppController was using hardcoded version 1.0.3
   - NdiSender was using hardcoded version 1.0.2
   - Both now use NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION from version.h

6. **Logging Consistency**: Updated all components
   - MediaFoundationCapture now uses Logger
   - MFCaptureDevice now uses Logger  
   - MFVideoCapture now uses Logger
   - All components now log with consistent format

## Changes Made
1. Created new logger utility class (logger.h and logger.cpp) that implements:
   - Format: `[module_name] [timestamp] message`
   - Timestamp includes milliseconds
   - Different log levels (LVL_INFO, LVL_WARNING, LVL_ERROR, LVL_DEBUG)
   - Version logging on startup per LLM instructions

2. Updated main.cpp:
   - Added logger initialization
   - Replaced all cout/cerr with Logger calls (except in parseArgs)
   - Version is logged on startup with proper format

3. Updated app_controller.cpp:
   - Replaced all cout/cerr with Logger calls
   - Fixed version to use NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION

4. Updated ndi_sender.cpp:
   - Replaced all cout/cerr with Logger calls
   - Fixed version to use NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION

5. Updated Media Foundation components:
   - media_foundation_capture.cpp - uses Logger
   - mf_capture_device.cpp - uses Logger (added wideToUtf8 helper)
   - mf_video_capture.cpp - uses Logger

6. Updated CMakeLists.txt:
   - Added logger.cpp to COMMON_SOURCES
   - Bumped version to 1.2.1

7. Updated version.h:
   - Incremented patch version to 1.2.1

## Testing Progress
- ✅ Code compiles successfully on Windows
- ✅ Initial test run showed partial logging working
- ⏳ Awaiting full application test with all components

## Issues Found in Initial Test
- ✅ Fixed: AppController showed wrong version (1.0.3)
- ✅ Fixed: NdiSender not using new logger
- ✅ Fixed: MediaFoundationCapture not using new logger
- ✅ Fixed: Device enumeration output not using logger
- ⚠️ Noted: Log overlap issue may be threading related

## Next Steps
1. User needs to rebuild the application
2. Run full test to verify all logging is consistent
3. Check that all components use proper format
4. Verify no more raw cout/cerr output

## User Actions Required
1. Rebuild the project with latest changes
2. Run the application with device selection
3. Provide full console output showing:
   - All startup messages
   - Device enumeration
   - Capture initialization
   - Normal operation
4. Confirm all logs follow format: `[module] [timestamp] message`

## Branch Information
- Working branch: feature/consistent-logging  
- Base branch: main
- Version bumped: 1.2.0 → 1.2.1
- PR: #7 - https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/ndi-bridge/pull/7

## Latest Commits
- Fixed compilation errors by removing Logger usage before initialization
- Fixed Windows localtime security warning
- Fixed Windows macro conflict with ERROR enum value
- Fixed Windows macro conflicts with LOG_* names by using LVL_* names instead
- Fixed app_controller to use NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION from version.h
- Updated NdiSender to use new Logger class
- Updated MediaFoundationCapture to use new Logger class
- Updated MFCaptureDevice to use new Logger class
- Updated MFVideoCapture to use new Logger class

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-15 21:00
- Action: Ran initial test showing partial logging implementation
- Result: Found several components not using new logger
- Next Required: Rebuild and test complete implementation
