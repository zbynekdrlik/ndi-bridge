# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed frame rate issue - NDI now uses actual capture rate (v1.1.5)
- [x] Fixed statistics display - shows stats when Enter pressed (v1.1.5)
- [x] Fixed Media Foundation cleanup (v1.1.6) - but didn't work for NZXT
- [x] Fixed NZXT card issue - skip cleanup for NZXT devices (v1.1.7)
- [ ] Currently working on: Waiting for user to test v1.1.7 NZXT fix
- [ ] Waiting for: User to rebuild and test if NZXT card issue is finally resolved
- [ ] Blocked by: Need test results before PR merge

## GOAL 11: Test and Fix v1.1.3 Issues (IN PROGRESS)
### Objective: Identify and fix functionality issues

### Status: v1.1.7 NZXT FINAL FIX IMPLEMENTED - TESTING REQUIRED

### Issues Fixed in v1.1.7:
1. **NZXT Capture Card Shutdown Issue (Final Fix)** üöß
   - Problem: NZXT card loses input signal after app exit, requires power cycle
   - v1.1.6 tried to avoid shutdown but still had issues
   - v1.1.7 Fix: Detect NZXT devices and skip ALL cleanup in destructor
   - Let OS handle cleanup on process exit for NZXT devices
   - Version: MediaFoundationCapture v1.0.10

### Testing Required:
1. **Clean rebuild of v1.1.7**
   ```
   git checkout feature/fix-v1.1.3-issues
   git pull
   cmake --build . --config Release --clean-first
   ```

2. **Test NZXT Capture Card**
   ```
   ndi-bridge.exe -t mf -l
   ndi-bridge.exe  (select NZXT device)
   ```
   - Should show: "NZXT device detected - special handling enabled"
   - Let it run for a bit
   - Press Enter to stop
   - Should show: "NZXT device - skipping full cleanup to prevent input loss"
   - **Verify monitor connected to NZXT still works**
   - **No need to power cycle NZXT**

3. **Test DeckLink** (regression test)
   ```
   ndi-bridge.exe -t dl -l
   ndi-bridge.exe  (select DL device)
   ```
   - Verify still works properly
   - Frame drops still minimal

4. **Test non-NZXT Media Foundation device** (if available)
   - Should still get proper cleanup (no special message)

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Bug Fixing
- Step: v1.1.7 NZXT final fix implemented, awaiting test results
- Status: TESTING_REQUIRED

## Code Changes Summary v1.1.7

### media_foundation_capture.cpp (v1.0.10)
- Added is_nzxt_device_ member variable
- Detect NZXT devices by name in initializeDevice()
- Skip all cleanup in destructor for NZXT devices
- Let OS handle cleanup for NZXT to prevent driver issues

### media_foundation_capture.h
- Added is_nzxt_device_ boolean member

### version.h
- Updated to v1.1.7

## Fix Evolution:
- v1.1.5: Basic fixes (frame rate, stats)
- v1.1.6: Tried to avoid full shutdown - didn't work for NZXT
- v1.1.7: NZXT-specific fix - skip cleanup entirely for NZXT

## Next Steps
1. User rebuilds with v1.1.7
2. Test NZXT capture card specifically
3. Verify monitor stays active after app exit
4. No power cycle needed
5. If successful, merge PR
6. If still issues, investigate USB driver interactions

## PR Status
- PR #2: "Fix v1.1.3 Runtime Issues"
- Branch: feature/fix-v1.1.3-issues
- Ready for v1.1.7 testing

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-15 (current session)
- Action: Reported NZXT still loses signal even with v1.1.5
- Result: Implemented NZXT-specific fix in v1.1.7
- Next Required: Rebuild and test v1.1.7
