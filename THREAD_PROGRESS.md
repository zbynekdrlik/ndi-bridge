# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Implementing consistent logging format per LLM instructions
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test the changes and provide logs
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Logging System Update
- Step: Implementation complete, awaiting testing
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| logger.h/cpp | ✅ v1.2.1 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| main.cpp logging | ✅ v1.2.1 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| app_controller logging | ✅ v1.2.1 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Changes Made
1. Created new logger utility class (logger.h and logger.cpp) that implements:
   - Format: `[module_name] [timestamp] message`
   - Timestamp includes milliseconds
   - Different log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG)
   - Version logging on startup per LLM instructions

2. Updated main.cpp:
   - Added logger initialization
   - Replaced all cout/cerr with Logger calls
   - Version is logged on startup with proper format

3. Updated app_controller.cpp:
   - Replaced all cout/cerr with Logger calls
   - Version logged on initialization

4. Updated CMakeLists.txt:
   - Added logger.cpp to COMMON_SOURCES
   - Bumped version to 1.2.1

5. Updated version.h:
   - Incremented patch version to 1.2.1

## Next Steps
1. User needs to build and test the changes
2. Verify log output follows the format: `[module_name] [timestamp] message`
3. Confirm version is logged on startup
4. Check that all logging is consistent throughout the application

## User Actions Required
1. Build the project on the feature branch
2. Run the application
3. Provide logs showing:
   - Startup with version message
   - Normal operation logs
   - Any error logs
4. Confirm the format is correct

## Branch Information
- Working branch: feature/consistent-logging
- Base branch: main
- Version bumped: 1.2.0 → 1.2.1
