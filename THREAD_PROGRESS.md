## Implementation Status
- Phase: Planning - Code Refactoring
- Step: Goal setting for source code restructuring
- Status: PLANNING

## Project Overview
- **Repository**: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/ndi-bridge
- **Active Branch**: feature/initial-project-setup
- **Pull Request**: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/ndi-bridge/pull/1
- **Purpose**: Low-latency HDMI to NDI bridge for Windows and Linux

## Current Goal: Code Refactoring
**GOAL 1**: Refactor existing monolithic source files into well-structured, multi-file codebase

### Refactoring Plan
1. **Media Foundation Code**
   - Current: Single large source file
   - Target Structure:
     ```
     src/windows/media_foundation/
     ├── mf_capture_device.h/cpp      # Device enumeration and management
     ├── mf_video_capture.h/cpp       # Video capture implementation
     ├── mf_audio_capture.h/cpp       # Audio capture implementation
     ├── mf_format_converter.h/cpp    # Format conversion utilities
     ├── mf_callback_handler.h/cpp    # Async callbacks
     └── mf_error_handling.h/cpp      # Error handling utilities
     ```

2. **DeckLink Code**
   - Current: Single large source file
   - Target Structure:
     ```
     src/windows/decklink/
     ├── decklink_device.h/cpp        # Device enumeration and management
     ├── decklink_capture.h/cpp       # Capture implementation
     ├── decklink_callback.h/cpp      # DeckLink callbacks
     ├── decklink_format.h/cpp        # Format handling
     └── decklink_error.h/cpp         # Error handling
     ```

3. **Common Components**
   ```
   src/common/
   ├── capture_interface.h           # Abstract capture interface
   ├── frame_buffer.h/cpp           # Frame buffer management
   ├── ndi_output.h/cpp             # NDI output handling
   ├── config_manager.h/cpp         # Configuration management
   ├── logger.h/cpp                 # Logging system
   └── utils.h/cpp                  # Common utilities
   ```

### Refactoring Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/file has one clear purpose
- **Interface-based Design**: Common interfaces for different capture methods
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling between components
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error management
- **Performance**: Maintain low-latency requirements
- **Testability**: Design for unit testing

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Created ndi-bridge repository
2. ✅ Set up feature branch for development
3. ✅ Created comprehensive project structure
4. ✅ Established build system (CMake)
5. ✅ Created documentation framework
6. ✅ Set refactoring goal and plan

## Next Steps (for new thread)
1. **Receive Media Foundation source file**
2. **Analyze code structure and dependencies**
3. **Create interface definitions**
4. **Begin systematic refactoring**:
   - Extract device enumeration
   - Separate capture logic
   - Isolate format conversion
   - Create callback handlers
5. **Repeat process for DeckLink code**
6. **Create common abstractions**
7. **Update CMakeLists.txt**
8. **Add unit tests**

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Repo Setup | ✅         | N/A         | N/A                | N/A                   |
| Structure  | ✅         | N/A         | N/A                | N/A                   |
| Refactoring| ❌         | ❌          | ❌                 | ❌                    |

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-11 08:52:00
- Action: Set first goal to refactor monolithic source files
- Result: Goal documented and plan created
- Next Required: **Start new thread with source code for refactoring**

## Handoff Notes for Next Thread
- **Primary Task**: Refactor monolithic Media Foundation and DeckLink source files
- **Approach**: Systematic extraction into logical components
- **Key Focus**: Maintain performance while improving structure
- **Branch**: Continue on `feature/initial-project-setup`
- **First Step**: Request Media Foundation source file for analysis
