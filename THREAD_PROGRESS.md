# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Zero-copy optimization SUCCESSFULLY TESTED - 52% latency reduction!
- [ ] Waiting for: Next thread to implement Priority 2 - Multi-threaded Pipeline
- [ ] Blocked by: None - ready for next optimization phase

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Performance Optimization - Priority 1 COMPLETE ✅
- Step: Ready for Priority 2 - Multi-threaded Pipeline
- Status: TESTING_COMPLETE - Zero-copy working perfectly
- Version: 1.4.0 (tested and working)

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| NDI YUYV Support | ✅ v1.4.0 | ❌ | ✅ WORKING | ❌ |
| AVX2 YUYV→UYVY | ✅ v1.4.0 | ❌ | ✅ WORKING | ❌ |
| Zero-Copy Path | ✅ v1.4.0 | ❌ | ✅ WORKING | ❌ |
| V4L2 processFrame | ✅ v1.4.0 | ❌ | ✅ WORKING | ❌ |

## 🎉 ZERO-COPY OPTIMIZATION RESULTS (v1.4.0)

### Performance Achieved:
- **Average Latency**: 16.068ms → **7.621ms** (52% reduction!)
- **Max Latency**: 20.757ms → **17.841ms**
- **FPS**: 55 (excellent for 60fps source)
- **Zero-copy frames**: 550/550 (100%)
- **Dropped frames**: 0

### Test Environment:
- Hardware: Intel N100 PC with NZXT Signal HD60 USB capture card
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- NDI SDK: Version 6.2.0.3
- Video: 1920x1080 @ 60fps YUYV

### Confirmed Working Features:
- ✅ YUYV format detected and using zero-copy path
- ✅ AVX2 optimized YUYV→UYVY conversion in NDI sender
- ✅ No BGRA conversion happening (skipped entirely)
- ✅ Direct V4L2 buffer to NDI pipeline

## 🎯 NEXT OPTIMIZATION: MULTI-THREADED PIPELINE

### Priority 2 Design (Target: -2ms additional reduction)
**Current Single-Thread Flow**:
```
poll() → dequeue() → YUYV→UYVY convert → NDI_send() → requeue()
```

**Proposed 3-Thread Architecture**:
```
Thread 1 (Capture): poll() → dequeue() → push to queue1 → requeue()
Thread 2 (Convert): pop from queue1 → YUYV→UYVY → push to queue2
Thread 3 (Send): pop from queue2 → NDI_send()
```

### Implementation Plan:
1. **Lock-free queues** between threads (boost::lockfree or custom)
2. **Ring buffer** for frame data (pre-allocated)
3. **Thread affinity** for CPU core optimization
4. **Performance metrics** per thread

### Expected Benefits:
- Capture never blocks on conversion/sending
- Better CPU core utilization on N100 (4 cores)
- Potential to hit 5-6ms total latency

## Commands for Next Thread

### Continue Development:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/ndi-test/ndi-bridge
git checkout feature/linux-performance-optimization
git pull origin feature/linux-performance-optimization

# Current working version is 1.4.0
# Next version will be 1.5.0 for multi-threading
```

### Test Current Optimized Build:
```bash
cd build
sudo ./bin/ndi-bridge --device /dev/video0 --ndi-name "NZXT-Optimized" -v
```

### Performance Monitoring:
```bash
# Watch latency in real-time
watch -n 0.1 'sudo ./bin/ndi-bridge --device /dev/video0 2>&1 | grep -E "Avg latency|Zero-copy"'

# CPU core usage
htop

# Detailed perf analysis
sudo perf record -g ./bin/ndi-bridge --device /dev/video0
sudo perf report
```

## Implementation Notes for Next Thread

### Multi-threading Considerations:
1. **Memory allocation**: All buffers pre-allocated at startup
2. **Queue depth**: Start with 3-5 frames per queue
3. **Synchronization**: Avoid mutexes in hot path
4. **Error handling**: Graceful degradation if thread fails

### Code Structure:
- Add new files:
  - `src/common/frame_queue.h/cpp` - Lock-free queue implementation
  - `src/common/thread_pool.h/cpp` - Thread management
- Modify:
  - `v4l2_capture.cpp` - Split into capture thread only
  - `ndi_sender.cpp` - Add async send capability

## Success Metrics for Priority 2:
- [ ] Average latency < 6ms
- [ ] CPU usage distributed across cores
- [ ] No frame drops under load
- [ ] Smooth 60fps output

## Current Branch State:
- Branch: `feature/linux-performance-optimization`
- Version: 1.4.0
- All changes committed and pushed
- PR #9 open and ready for review after all optimizations

## Notes:
- Zero-copy optimization exceeded expectations (52% reduction vs 30% target)
- System is already very performant at 7.6ms
- Multi-threading is next logical step for further gains
- Consider if 7.6ms is sufficient before implementing more complexity
