# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Linux V4L2 latency optimization v1.7.0
- [x] Waiting for: User to test v1.7.0 implementation
- [ ] Blocked by: None - implementation complete, needs testing

## Implementation Status
- Phase: **Linux V4L2 Latency Fix** - All optimizations implemented
- Step: v1.7.0 COMPLETE - Ready for testing
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
- Version: 1.7.0

## Linux V4L2 Latency Fix - IMPLEMENTED ✅
**v1.7.0 Changes**:
- ✅ Removed all sleeps in multi-threaded pipeline
- ✅ Reduced buffer counts (10→6 normal, 4 low latency)
- ✅ Reduced queue depths (5→3/2 normal, 2/1 low latency)
- ✅ Immediate polling (0ms timeout)
- ✅ Added single-threaded mode option
- ✅ Added low latency mode
- ✅ Added end-to-end latency tracking
- ✅ Command-line options: --single-thread, --low-latency

## Testing Required
1. **Basic Multi-threaded Test**:
   ```bash
   ./ndi-bridge -d /dev/video0 -n "Test Stream"
   ```
   - Expected: Should show reduced latency from 12 frames

2. **Single-threaded Test**:
   ```bash
   ./ndi-bridge -d /dev/video0 -n "Test Stream" --single-thread
   ```
   - Expected: Lowest latency, around 8 frames

3. **Low Latency Mode Test**:
   ```bash
   ./ndi-bridge -d /dev/video0 -n "Test Stream" --low-latency
   ```
   - Expected: Forces single-thread + minimal buffers, 8 frames

4. **Verbose Mode for Stats**:
   ```bash
   ./ndi-bridge -d /dev/video0 -n "Test Stream" --single-thread -v
   ```
   - Should show E2E latency statistics every 10 seconds

## Key Changes Made
1. **v4l2_capture.h**:
   - Added low latency mode support
   - Reduced buffer counts and queue depths
   - Added E2E latency tracking in stats
   - Dynamic configuration based on mode

2. **v4l2_capture.cpp**:
   - Removed 100μs sleeps in convert/send threads
   - Tight polling loops for immediate response
   - Reduced poll timeouts to 0ms (immediate)
   - Enhanced statistics with E2E latency

3. **main.cpp**:
   - Added --single-thread option
   - Added --low-latency option
   - Interactive mode prompts for performance
   - Updated help text

## Performance Expectations
- **Multi-threaded**: ~10 frames (down from 12)
- **Single-threaded**: ~8 frames (matches Windows)
- **Low latency mode**: ~8 frames (most aggressive settings)

## Repository State
- Main branch: v1.6.7
- Current branch: fix/linux-v4l2-latency (v1.7.0)
- PR: Not created yet (no commits initially)
- Windows latency: FIXED (8 frames) ✅
- Linux latency: IMPLEMENTED (awaiting test) ⏳

## Next Steps
1. User tests the implementation with 60fps camera
2. Measure round-trip latency
3. Compare single vs multi-threaded modes
4. Check CPU usage
5. If successful, create PR and merge

## Quick Reference
- Current version: 1.7.0
- Branch: fix/linux-v4l2-latency
- Files changed: 5 (version.h, v4l2_capture.h/cpp, main.cpp, CHANGELOG.md)
- Windows latency: 8 frames ✅
- Linux latency: 12 frames → 8 frames (expected)
