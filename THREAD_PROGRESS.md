# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Completed logging implementation for all components
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test complete implementation
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Logging System Update
- Step: Implementation complete, awaiting final testing
- Status: TESTING_PARTIAL

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| logger.h/cpp | ✅ v1.2.1 | ✅ Compiles | ✅ Initial test | ❌ |
| main.cpp logging | ✅ v1.2.1 | ✅ Compiles | ✅ Initial test | ❌ |
| app_controller logging | ✅ v1.2.1 | ✅ Fixed version | ❌ | ❌ |
| ndi_sender logging | ✅ v1.2.1 | ✅ Updated | ❌ | ❌ |
| media_foundation logging | ✅ v1.2.1 | ✅ Updated | ❌ | ❌ |

## Completed Work Summary

### Issues Fixed
1. **Compilation Errors**: 
   - Fixed Windows macro conflicts (ERROR, LOG_*) by using LVL_* enum names
   - Fixed localtime security warning with localtime_s on Windows
   - Removed Logger usage before initialization in parseArgs()

2. **Version Management**:
   - Fixed hardcoded versions in AppController (was 1.0.3)
   - Fixed hardcoded versions in NdiSender (was 1.0.2)
   - All components now use NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION from version.h

3. **Logging Consistency**:
   - Created new Logger class with format: `[module_name] [timestamp] message`
   - Updated all components to use new Logger
   - Added timestamps with milliseconds
   - Implemented log levels: LVL_INFO, LVL_WARNING, LVL_ERROR, LVL_DEBUG

### Components Updated
- logger.h/cpp - New implementation
- main.cpp - Uses Logger except in parseArgs()
- app_controller.cpp - Full Logger integration
- ndi_sender.cpp - Full Logger integration
- media_foundation_capture.cpp - Full Logger integration
- mf_capture_device.cpp - Full Logger integration with string conversion
- mf_video_capture.cpp - Full Logger integration

### Version
- Bumped from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1

## Initial Test Results
User ran initial test showing:
- Main app logs correctly: `[ndi-bridge] [2025-07-15 21:00:33.498] Script version 1.2.1 loaded`
- Issues found and fixed:
  - AppController had wrong version (fixed)
  - NdiSender not using Logger (fixed)
  - MediaFoundation components not using Logger (fixed)

## Next Thread Goals
User has identified improvements for next thread:
1. **Single Version Source**: Remove separate version logging for each component
   - Currently each component logs "Script version X.Y.Z loaded"
   - Should have single version for entire application
   - Version should be sourced from one place only

2. **Simplify Log Format**: Remove module name from log format
   - Current: `[module_name] [timestamp] message`
   - Proposed: `[timestamp] message`
   - Reasoning: In compiled exe, module names are not helpful

## User Actions Required
1. Test the complete implementation
2. Verify all logging is consistent
3. Provide feedback on current format
4. Approve for merge or request additional changes

## Branch Information
- Working branch: feature/consistent-logging  
- Base branch: main
- Version: 1.2.1
- PR: #7 - https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/ndi-bridge/pull/7

## Handoff Notes for Next Thread
1. Review current Logger implementation in logger.h/cpp
2. Consider removing Logger::logVersion() calls from individual components
3. Update log format to remove module_name_ prefix
4. Ensure single version source (likely just main.cpp startup)
5. Test thoroughly to ensure no component identification issues

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-15 21:09
- Action: Requested new thread goals be set
- Result: Thread progress updated with completion status and next goals
- Next Required: Continue in new thread with specified improvements
