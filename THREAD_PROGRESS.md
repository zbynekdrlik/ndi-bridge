   - Version updated to 1.0.1
   - **FIXED**: Commented out non-existent v4l2 library

5. **Interface Fixes** ✅ v1.0.1
   - **capture_interface.h**: Completely rewritten to match actual usage
   - **media_foundation_capture.h/cpp**: Updated to implement correct interface
   - Method names now use camelCase as expected
   - Proper error handling with atomic flags
   - Thread-safe implementations

## Critical Fixes Applied (v1.0.1)
1. ✅ **Interface Mismatch Fixed**: ICaptureDevice now matches app_controller usage
2. ✅ **Missing Header Fixed**: Added fcntl.h for Linux compilation path
3. ✅ **MediaFoundationCapture Fixed**: Now implements correct interface methods
4. ✅ **Unused Member Removed**: Cleaned up ndi_sender.h/.cpp
5. ✅ **CMakeLists Fixed**: v4l2 library commented out
6. ✅ **Version Updated**: Incremented to 1.0.1

## Build Instructions
```bash
# Windows build instructions:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build . --config Release

# Run with:
./bin/Release/ndi-bridge.exe --help
./bin/Release/ndi-bridge.exe --list-devices
./bin/Release/ndi-bridge.exe -d "Device Name" -n "NDI Source Name"
```

## Command-Line Options
- `-d, --device <n>`: Capture device name (default: first available)
- `-n, --ndi-name <n>`: NDI sender name (default: 'NDI Bridge')
- `-l, --list-devices`: List available capture devices
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose logging
- `--no-retry`: Disable automatic retry on errors
- `--retry-delay <ms>`: Delay between retries (default: 5000)
- `--max-retries <count>`: Maximum retry attempts (-1 for infinite)
- `-h, --help`: Show help message
- `--version`: Show version information

## Next Steps for User
1. **Build the project**:
   - Ensure NDI SDK is installed or available in deps/ndi/
   - Use CMake to generate build files
   - Build in Release mode for best performance

2. **Test basic functionality**:
   - Run with `--list-devices` to verify device enumeration
   - Test capture with default device
   - Verify NDI output with NDI Studio Monitor

3. **Verify against original**:
   - Compare frame quality
   - Check CPU usage
   - Verify stability over time

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Initial project structure created
2. ✅ Media Foundation code refactored into modules
3. ✅ All components committed to repository
4. ✅ Deep code verification completed
5. ✅ Verification report created
6. ✅ PR updated with findings
