## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Repository created: ndi-bridge
- [x] Feature branch created: feature/initial-project-setup
- [x] README.md updated with comprehensive documentation
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Pull Request created: #1
- [ ] Currently working on: Waiting for user to provide source code
- [ ] Waiting for: User to provide existing Media Foundation and DeckLink source code
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Initial Setup
- Step: Repository structure complete, waiting for source code
- Status: WAITING FOR USER INPUT

## Project Overview
- **Repository**: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/ndi-bridge
- **Active Branch**: feature/initial-project-setup
- **Pull Request**: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/ndi-bridge/pull/1
- **Purpose**: Low-latency HDMI to NDI bridge for Windows and Linux
- **Key Components**:
  - Windows: Media Foundation + DeckLink SDK
  - Linux: Minimal bootable USB implementation
  - Common: NDI SDK integration

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Created ndi-bridge repository
2. ✅ Set up feature branch for development
3. ✅ Created comprehensive README.md
4. ✅ Established project directory structure:
   - src/common, src/windows, src/linux
   - include/, deps/, docs/, scripts/, tests/
5. ✅ Added CMakeLists.txt for build configuration
6. ✅ Created documentation (architecture.md)
7. ✅ Added version header (0.1.0)
8. ✅ Set up .gitignore for build artifacts
9. ✅ Added CONTRIBUTING.md and LICENSE (MIT)
10. ✅ Created Pull Request #1 for tracking

## Next Steps
1. **WAITING**: User to provide existing source code:
   - Media Foundation implementation
   - DeckLink SDK implementation
2. Integrate provided code into project structure
3. Update CMakeLists.txt with actual source files
4. Create Windows-specific build configuration
5. Plan Linux bootable USB implementation
