# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Build successful! v1.0.4 compiled and running
- [x] Original code saved as reference
- [ ] Currently working on: Interactive device selection missing
- [ ] Waiting for: Decision on restoring interactive menu
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## DISCOVERED ISSUE: Missing Interactive Device Selection
**Problem**: Refactored code auto-selects first device when no `-d` parameter provided
**Original behavior**: Shows numbered menu and waits for user selection

### Original Interactive Menu Code (lines 534-547):
```cpp
if (!useCmdLine)
{
    std::wcout << L"Available Media Foundation Devices:\n";
    for (size_t i = 0; i < devList.size(); i++)
    {
        std::wcout << i << L": " << devNames[i] << std::endl;
    }
    std::cout << "Select device index: ";
    std::cin >> chosenIndex;
    std::cout << "Enter NDI stream name: ";
    std::cin >> ndiName;
}
```

### Where it was lost:
In `MediaFoundationCapture::initializeDevice()` (media_foundation_capture.cpp:147-158):
```cpp
if (selected_device_name_.empty()) {
    // Use first available device  <-- AUTO-SELECTS!
    // ...
    selected_device_name_ = devices[0].friendly_name;
}
```

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Testing and Bug Fixes
- Step: Interactive menu restoration
- Status: BUILD_SUCCESS_WITH_ISSUES
- Version: 1.0.4

## Build Test Results ✅
- **Build**: Success
- **Version output**: "NDI Bridge version 1.0.4 starting..."
- **NDI SDK**: 6.1.1.0 loaded correctly
- **Device detection**: Found 5 devices (4 NDI Webcam + 1 Integrated Camera)
- **Capture**: Successfully capturing at 1920x1080 @ 29.97 fps
- **NDI output**: Broadcasting as "NDI Bridge"

## Issues Found:
1. **Missing interactive device selection** - auto-selects first device
2. **No Release build configuration** in Visual Studio (only Debug available)

## Previous Goals Completed:
### ✅ GOAL 1: Initial Project Structure
- Created organized directory structure
- Set up CMake configuration
- Added documentation templates

### ✅ GOAL 2: Media Foundation Refactoring
- Modularized capture code
- Created reusable components
- Improved error handling

### ✅ GOAL 3: Integration Components (v1.0.3)
- Main application implemented
- NDI sender module created
- Application controller developed
- All compilation errors fixed

### ✅ GOAL 4: NDI SDK Configuration (v1.0.4)
- CMakeLists.txt updated for NDI 6 SDK
- Proper path handling implemented
- DLL copy mechanism fixed
- Version header compilation error fixed
- **First successful build and run!**

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-14 19:31:00
- Action: Provided original code and asked why interactive menu is missing
- Result: Identified the issue - device selection logic moved to wrong layer
- Next Required: Decide whether to restore interactive menu functionality

## Notes
- Project builds and runs successfully
- NDI streaming confirmed working
- Interactive device selection was lost during refactoring
- Original functionality preserved in reference file
- Architecture issue: UI logic (device selection) incorrectly placed in capture layer
