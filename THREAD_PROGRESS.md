# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Created feature/fix-v1.1.3-issues branch
- [x] Fixed version display issue (now shows 1.1.4)
- [x] Fixed AppController race condition causing immediate shutdown
- [x] Fixed DeckLink 50% frame drop issue with direct callbacks
- [ ] Currently working on: Waiting for user to test fixes
- [ ] Waiting for: User to rebuild and test v1.1.4
- [ ] Blocked by: Need test results before PR merge

## GOAL 11: Test and Fix v1.1.3 Issues (IN PROGRESS)
### Objective: Identify and fix functionality issues in v1.1.3

### Status: FIXES IMPLEMENTED - TESTING REQUIRED

### Issues Fixed in v1.1.4:
1. **Version Display Bug** ✅
   - Was showing "version 1.1.0" instead of correct version
   - Fixed: Updated version.h to 1.1.4
   - User needs to rebuild to see fix

2. **Media Foundation Startup Issue** ✅
   - App was shutting down immediately after start
   - Root cause: Race condition in AppController
   - Fixed: Set running_ flag before starting thread
   - Added frame monitoring to detect stalls

3. **DeckLink Frame Drop Crisis** ✅
   - 50% frame drop rate (polling every 10ms for 60fps)
   - Fixed: Implemented direct callbacks in DeckLinkCaptureDevice
   - No more polling delay - frames delivered immediately

### Testing Required:
1. **Clean rebuild of v1.1.4**
   ```
   cmake --build . --config Release --clean-first
   ```

2. **Test Media Foundation**
   ```
   ndi-bridge.exe -t mf -l
   ndi-bridge.exe  (select MF device)
   ```

3. **Test DeckLink**
   ```
   ndi-bridge.exe -t dl -l
   ndi-bridge.exe  (select DL device)
   ```

4. **Verify fixes**
   - Version should show 1.1.4
   - Media Foundation should not shut down immediately
   - DeckLink should show minimal frame drops

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Bug Fixing
- Step: Fixes implemented, awaiting test results
- Status: TESTING_REQUIRED
- Version: 1.1.4

## Code Changes Summary

### version.h (v1.1.4)
- Updated version string to "1.1.4"

### app_controller.cpp (v1.0.1)
- Fixed race condition: Set running_ = true BEFORE starting thread
- Added 100ms delay after thread start to ensure initialization
- Added frame monitoring with 5-second timeout detection
- Improved runLoop to actively monitor capture health

### decklink_capture.cpp/h (v1.1.1)
- Removed polling thread completely
- Added SetFrameCallback to DeckLinkCaptureDevice
- Frames now delivered directly via callback
- Eliminated 10ms polling delay

### DeckLinkCaptureDevice.cpp
- Added ProcessFrameForCallback for immediate delivery
- Callback path bypasses frame queue
- Falls back to queue if no callback set

### CMakeLists.txt & CHANGELOG.md
- Updated version to 1.1.4
- Documented all fixes

## Next Steps
1. User rebuilds with v1.1.4
2. Test all capture types
3. Verify fixes work
4. If successful, merge PR
5. If issues remain, debug and fix

## PR Status
- PR #2: "Fix v1.1.3 Runtime Issues"
- Branch: feature/fix-v1.1.3-issues
- Ready for testing

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-15 (earlier in session)
- Action: Provided logs showing version 1.1.0 and 50% frame drops
- Result: Implemented fixes in v1.1.4
- Next Required: Rebuild and test v1.1.4

## Technical Details of Fixes

### Race Condition Fix
```cpp
// OLD: running_ set AFTER thread started
worker_thread_ = std::thread(&AppController::runLoop, this);
running_ = true;  // Too late!

// NEW: running_ set BEFORE thread starts
running_ = true;
worker_thread_ = std::thread(&AppController::runLoop, this);
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
```

### Frame Drop Fix
```cpp
// OLD: Polling with 10ms sleep
while (m_threadRunning) {
    if (GetNextFrame(frame)) {
        onFrameReceived(frame);
    } else {
        sleep(10ms);  // Too slow for 60fps!
    }
}

// NEW: Direct callback
m_captureDevice->SetFrameCallback([this](const FrameData& frame) {
    onFrameReceived(frame);  // Immediate!
});
```
