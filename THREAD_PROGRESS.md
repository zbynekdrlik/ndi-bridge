# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed compilation errors in v1.0.6 
- [x] Include paths corrected for header files
- [ ] Currently working on: Ready for build and test v1.0.6
- [ ] Waiting for: User to build and test
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## FIXED IN v1.0.6
### Compilation Error Fixes:
1. ✅ **Include path errors fixed** - Changed relative includes from "common/..." to "../../common/..."
2. ✅ **Header file locations** - All headers properly referenced from src directory structure
3. ✅ **Version updated** - Bumped to 1.0.6 to reflect fixes

### Files Modified:
- `src/windows/media_foundation/media_foundation_capture.h` - Fixed include path
- `src/windows/media_foundation/mf_video_capture.h` - Fixed include path  
- `src/common/version.h` - Updated version to 1.0.6
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Updated project version to 1.0.6

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Compilation Error Fixes
- Step: Ready for testing
- Status: COMPILATION_ERRORS_FIXED
- Version: 1.0.6

## All Features Previously Restored (v1.0.5):
1. ✅ **Interactive device selection menu** - Shows numbered list when no `-d` parameter
2. ✅ **Command-line positional parameters** - Supports `ndi-bridge.exe "device" "ndi_name"`
3. ✅ **Interactive NDI name input** - Prompts for NDI stream name
4. ✅ **Wait for Enter in CLI mode** - Waits before closing when using positional params
5. ✅ **Device re-enumeration** - Re-finds device after disconnect/reconnect

## Testing Scenarios to Verify:
1. **Build success**: Code should compile without errors
2. **Interactive mode**: Run without parameters, should show device menu
3. **Positional params**: `ndi-bridge.exe "Integrated Camera" "My NDI"`
4. **Named params**: `ndi-bridge.exe -d "Integrated Camera" -n "My NDI"`
5. **Device disconnect**: Unplug device while running, should retry
6. **CLI wait**: Should wait for Enter when using positional params

## Previous Goals Completed:
### ✅ GOAL 1: Initial Project Structure
### ✅ GOAL 2: Media Foundation Refactoring
### ✅ GOAL 3: Integration Components (v1.0.3)
### ✅ GOAL 4: NDI SDK Configuration (v1.0.4)
### ✅ GOAL 5: Feature Restoration (v1.0.5)
### ✅ GOAL 6: Fix Compilation Errors (v1.0.6)

## Command-Line Options (Complete)
- `ndi-bridge.exe "device_name" "ndi_name"` - Positional parameters ✅
- `-d, --device <n>`: Capture device name (default: interactive) ✅
- `-n, --ndi-name <n>`: NDI sender name (default: interactive/"NDI Bridge") ✅
- `-l, --list-devices`: List available capture devices
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose logging
- `--no-retry`: Disable automatic retry on errors
- `--retry-delay <ms>`: Delay between retries (default: 5000)
- `--max-retries <count>`: Maximum retry attempts (-1 for infinite)
- `-h, --help`: Show help message
- `--version`: Show version information

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-14 20:10:00
- Action: Reported compilation errors after v1.0.5
- Result: Fixed include path errors in v1.0.6
- Next Required: Build and test v1.0.6

## Notes
- User correctly pointed out that code should never be left with compilation errors
- Include paths were incorrectly specified for the src directory structure
- Fixed by updating relative paths in header files
- Version bumped to 1.0.6 to track the fix
- Ready for build and test
