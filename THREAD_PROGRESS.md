## PR Status
**PR #8**: [feat: Add Linux USB capture card support (V4L2)](https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/ndi-bridge/pull/8)
- Status: Open
- Files changed: 15 (was 10)
- Additions: +2200 (approximate)
- Deletions: -91
- Ready for: Testing with Intel N100 optimizations

## Testing Required
- [ ] Build on Linux x64 (Ubuntu 20.04+) with AVX2 support
- [ ] Verify AVX2 detection on Intel N100
- [ ] Test device enumeration
- [ ] Test with USB webcam
- [ ] Test with HDMI capture card (NZXT or similar)
- [ ] Verify format conversion quality
- [ ] Check memory usage and leaks (valgrind)
- [ ] Performance testing (CPU usage < 10% target)
- [ ] Measure AVX2 performance improvement
- [ ] Error handling (device disconnect/reconnect)
- [ ] Long-running stability test
- [ ] Verify version 1.3.1 logged on startup

## Performance Targets (Intel N100)
- 1080p60 capture: < 10% CPU usage
- Frame latency: < 16ms
- Zero frame drops under normal load
- Memory usage: < 200MB
- Format conversion: < 5ms per frame

## Known Limitations
- MJPEG decompression not implemented (requires libjpeg)
- No DeckLink support on Linux (Windows only)
- Focus on USB capture devices only

## Next Steps
1. User to test Linux build on Intel N100 system
2. Benchmark AVX2 performance improvements
3. Fix any compilation issues
4. Test with actual hardware
5. Address feedback and bugs
6. Consider MJPEG support if needed
7. Merge PR after successful testing

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-16
- Action: Requested Intel N100 optimizations
- Result: AVX2 optimizations implemented, buffer count increased, v1.3.1
- Next Required: Build and test on Linux system with Intel N100
