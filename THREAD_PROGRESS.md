# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Created feature branch: feature/remove-enter-key-exit
- [x] Removed Enter key handling from main.cpp
- [x] Fixed double-stop issue causing hang on shutdown
- [x] Version bumped to 1.2.2
- [x] PR created: #4
- [ ] Currently working on: Testing the final fix
- [ ] Waiting for: User to compile and test
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## v1.2.2 24/7 Operation Improvements

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ **Removed Enter key handling**
   - Removed `isKeyPressed()` function
   - Removed `clearInput()` function
   - Updated main loop to only wait for shutdown signal

2. ✅ **Updated user interface**
   - Help text now mentions Ctrl+C instead of Enter
   - Running message says "Press Ctrl+C to stop..."
   - Removed "Press Enter to exit" in positional parameter mode

3. ✅ **Fixed shutdown hang issue**
   - Signal handler now only sets shutdown flag
   - Main code handles graceful shutdown (single stop call)
   - No more double-stop causing DeckLink hang

4. ✅ **Cleaner shutdown**
   - Final statistics display on shutdown
   - Consistent shutdown behavior across all modes

### Testing Required:
```bash
cmake --build . --config Release --clean-first
ndi-bridge.exe -t dl -l
ndi-bridge.exe -t dl
```

Verify:
- App does NOT exit when Enter is pressed
- App ONLY exits with Ctrl+C
- App shuts down cleanly without hanging
- Final statistics are displayed on shutdown
- "Application stopped successfully." appears at the end

## Implementation Status
- Phase: IMPROVEMENT
- Step: Code changes complete, needs testing
- Status: TESTING_REQUIRED
- Version: 1.2.2

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Compiled | Tested | User Approved |
|-----------|------------|----------|---------|---------------|
| main.cpp | ✅ v1.2.2 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| version.h | ✅ v1.2.2 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Benefits Achieved
- ✅ Robust 24/7 operation
- ✅ No accidental exits from Enter key
- ✅ Clean shutdown without hanging
- ✅ Cleaner code
- ✅ Consistent shutdown behavior

## Previous Context
- Previous thread was working on DeckLink refactoring (v1.2.0)
- That work was in branch feature/refactor-decklink-v1.2.0 (not found)
- Current task is independent improvement for 24/7 operation

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-15 (current session)
- Action: Reported app hanging on Ctrl+C shutdown
- Result: Fixed double-stop issue in signal handler
- Next Required: Compile and test the fix
