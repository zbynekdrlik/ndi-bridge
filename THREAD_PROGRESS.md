# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: v1.6.3 second callback fix implemented
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test v1.6.3 with BOTH callback fixes
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Latency Optimization - DeckLink TRUE Zero-Copy
- Step: v1.6.3 AppController callback fix
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
- Version: 1.6.3 (both callback initialization fixes)

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| DeckLink Zero Latency | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (100% direct) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Direct Frame Callback | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (100% direct) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Pre-allocated Buffers | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (8MB allocated) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Reduced Queue Size | ✅ v1.6.0 | ✅ (bypassed) | ❌ | ❌ |
| TRUE Zero-Copy UYVY | ✅ v1.6.1 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| DeckLink Callback Fix | ✅ v1.6.2 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| AppController Fix | ✅ v1.6.3 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## v1.6.3 Second Bug Fix Applied
**Fixed AppController Callback Initialization**:
- ✅ Set capture callbacks BEFORE calling startCapture()
- ✅ Ensures callbacks are ready when frames arrive
- ✅ Completes the callback initialization chain
- ✅ Both callback fixes now in place

## Recent Issues Found & Fixed
1. **v1.6.1 Frame Delivery Issue**:
   - Logs showed signal detected but 0 frames received
   - 293 frames dropped in 5 seconds
   - VideoInputFrameArrived callback wasn't delivering frames

2. **v1.6.2 First Fix** (DeckLink level):
   - Frame callback was being set BEFORE device initialization
   - Fixed: Initialize() → SetFrameCallback() → StartCapture()

3. **v1.6.3 Second Fix** (AppController level):
   - AppController was setting callbacks AFTER startCapture()
   - Fixed: setFrameCallback() → setErrorCallback() → startCapture()

## Complete Callback Chain (Fixed)
1. AppController sets callbacks on DeckLinkCapture
2. DeckLinkCapture::startCapture() initializes device
3. DeckLinkCapture sets callback on DeckLinkCaptureDevice
4. DeckLinkCaptureDevice starts capture
5. DeckLink SDK → DeckLinkCaptureCallback → DeckLinkCaptureDevice → DeckLinkCapture → AppController

## Version History
- v1.5.4: Color space fix
- v1.6.0: Queue bypass + direct callbacks (tested, working)
- v1.6.1: TRUE zero-copy for UYVY (callbacks not working)
- v1.6.2: Fixed DeckLink callback initialization order
- v1.6.3: Fixed AppController callback initialization order

## User Action Required
1. **Build v1.6.3** with BOTH callback fixes
2. **Run with DeckLink device** 
3. **Check startup logs** for:
   - "Version 1.6.3 loaded"
   - "DeckLink Capture v1.6.1" (internal version)
   - Frames should now be received!
4. **Monitor for success**:
   - Frame counter should increment
   - Zero-copy frames should show > 0
   - "TRUE ZERO-COPY: UYVY direct to NDI" message
   - No "No frames received" errors
5. **Provide logs** showing frames processing correctly

## Branch State
- Branch: `feature/decklink-latency-optimization`
- Version: 1.6.3 (IMPLEMENTED)
- Commits: 18
- Testing: NOT STARTED for v1.6.3
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
- PR: #11 OPEN

## Next Steps
1. ✅ v1.6.0 tested and working (queue bypass)
2. ✅ v1.6.1 TRUE zero-copy implemented
3. ✅ v1.6.2 DeckLink callback fix applied
4. ✅ v1.6.3 AppController callback fix applied
5. ⏳ User testing of v1.6.3 required
6. ⏳ Latency measurements needed
7. ⏳ PR #11 merge after v1.6.3 testing

## Technical Summary
The frame delivery issue required TWO fixes at different levels:
1. **DeckLink level**: Initialize device before setting callback
2. **AppController level**: Set callbacks before starting capture

Both fixes are now in place. The callback chain should work end-to-end.

## GOAL AFTER TESTING
Once v1.6.3 is confirmed working with 100% zero-copy:
1. **Merge PR #11** - DeckLink now matches Linux V4L2 performance
2. **v1.7.0**: AVX2 optimization for formats that DO need conversion
3. **v1.8.0**: Multi-threaded pipeline if further optimization needed
