- [ ] Waiting for: User to test build with fix
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Latency Optimization - DeckLink Implementation
- Step: Compilation fix applied
- Status: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
- Version: 1.6.0 (with compilation fix)

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| DeckLink Zero Latency | ✅ v1.6.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Direct Frame Callback | ✅ v1.6.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Pre-allocated Buffers | ✅ v1.6.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Reduced Queue Size | ✅ v1.6.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Recent Fix Applied
- **Issue**: CaptureStatistics struct was missing `metadata` field
- **Error**: `C2039 'metadata': is not a member of 'CaptureStatistics'`
- **Solution**: Added `std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> metadata;` to CaptureStatistics
- **File Modified**: `src/capture/ICaptureDevice.h`
- **Commit**: 9262889a55b027bcb21d52da437e050b61f39bb1

## Version.h Warnings
The macro redefinition warnings for `NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION_MINOR` and `NDI_BRIDGE_VERSION_STRING` are likely from CMake defining these during build. These are warnings only and shouldn't prevent compilation.

## Issue Description
DeckLink implementation has much worse latency than Linux V4L2 implementation. Need to apply the excellent techniques from Linux implementation to DeckLink.

## Analysis Results
### Linux V4L2 Low-Latency Techniques:
1. **Zero-copy path**: YUYV format passed directly without conversion
2. **Memory-mapped buffers**: Direct DMA access with V4L2_MEMORY_MMAP
3. **Non-blocking I/O**: O_NONBLOCK with poll() using 1-5ms timeout
4. **Pre-allocated buffers**: Conversion buffers allocated ahead of time
5. **Multi-threaded pipeline**: 3 threads with CPU affinity
6. **Lock-free queues**: Minimal locking for thread communication
7. **Immediate buffer requeuing**: Buffers requeued ASAP
8. **Hardware timestamps**: V4L2_BUF_FLAG_TIMESTAMP_MONOTONIC
9. **AVX2 SIMD optimization**: Process 16 pixels at once

### DeckLink Latency Issues Found:
1. **Frame queue buffering**: MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=3 adds 50ms latency at 60fps
2. **Synchronous processing**: No pipeline parallelism
3. **COM interface overhead**: Windows COM adds overhead
4. **No zero-copy path**: Always copies frame data
5. **No pre-allocation**: Allocates on-demand
6. **Scalar pixel processing**: No SIMD optimization (CRITICAL BOTTLENECK)

## Implementation Complete (v1.6.0)
1. ✅ **Reduced frame queue size** from 3 to 1 (saves ~33ms at 60fps)
2. ✅ **Zero-copy path** for UYVY format - passes frames directly
3. ✅ **Pre-allocated buffers** for BGRA conversion
4. ✅ **Direct callback mode** - bypasses queue entirely
5. ✅ **Performance tracking** - monitors zero-copy usage
6. ✅ **Low-latency mode flag** - default ON
7. ✅ **Metadata field added** to CaptureStatistics (compilation fix)

## Remaining Critical Optimizations Needed
1. **AVX2/SIMD Format Conversion** (5-10x speedup) - MOST CRITICAL
2. **Multi-threaded Pipeline** - 3 threads with CPU affinity
3. **Lock-free Queues** - Eliminate mutex contention
4. **Memory Alignment** - 32-byte alignment for AVX2
5. **Hardware Timestamps** - Use DeckLink hardware timestamps

## Version History
- v1.5.4: Color space fix complete (previous issue)
- v1.6.0: DeckLink latency optimization Phase 1 IMPLEMENTED (with compilation fix)
- v1.7.0: (PLANNED) AVX2 optimization for format conversion

## User Action Required
1. **Build the application** with the new changes
2. **Run with DeckLink device** 
3. **Check startup logs** for:
   - "DeckLink Capture v1.6.0 - Low-latency optimizations enabled"
   - "Low latency mode: ON"
4. **Monitor performance**:
   - Check for "Using zero-copy path for UYVY format" if applicable
   - Note final statistics showing zero-copy percentage
5. **Measure latency** and compare with previous version
6. **Provide logs** showing all the above

## GOAL FOR NEXT THREAD
**🎯 Implement AVX2/SIMD optimized format conversion for DeckLink (v1.7.0)**

### Objectives:
1. **Create DeckLinkFormatConverterAVX2 class**
   - Port V4L2's AVX2 optimization to DeckLink
   - Process 16 pixels at once using AVX2 instructions
   - Support UYVY->BGRA conversion with proper color space handling
   - Include CPU feature detection for AVX2 support

2. **Performance targets**:
   - Achieve 5-10x speedup in format conversion
   - Reduce conversion time from ~10ms to ~1-2ms for 1080p60
   - Match or exceed V4L2 conversion performance

3. **Implementation details**:
   - Use `_mm256_shuffle_epi8` for efficient byte reordering
   - Implement proper YUV->RGB coefficients for BT.601/BT.709
   - Handle edge cases for non-16-pixel-aligned widths
   - Add runtime CPU detection with fallback to scalar code

4. **Testing requirements**:
   - Benchmark conversion speed before/after
   - Verify color accuracy matches scalar implementation
   - Test on various resolutions and formats
   - Ensure compatibility with older CPUs without AVX2

This is the most critical optimization as the current pixel-by-pixel conversion is the primary latency bottleneck.
