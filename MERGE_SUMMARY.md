# Merge Summary: feature/status-monitoring → main

## Version: 1.6.7

## Overview
Complete dashboard overhaul with real-time monitoring capabilities, critical bug fixes, and improved production reliability.

## Major Features

### 1. Real-Time Dashboard Monitoring
- **Live capture status** with FPS tracking and color coding
- **10-minute performance history** with stability analysis  
- **Network throughput monitoring** from actual br0 interface
- **Device disconnection detection** - shows "NO DEVICE" when USB removed
- **PTP/NTP time sync status** independent of USB device

### 2. Quick Actions Menu
- Interactive shortcuts: [L]ogs, [S]et-name, [N]etwork, [T]ime-sync, [H]elp, [Q]uit
- Improved log viewer with paginated display (no more getting stuck)
- All actions return cleanly to dashboard

### 3. Web Interface Improvements
- Shows both short and full hostnames (e.g., cam2.local and ndi-bridge-cam2.local)
- Credentials displayed clearly
- Persistent tmux sessions for web terminal

## Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Dropped Frames Tracking (CRITICAL)
- **Bug**: `stats_.frames_dropped` was NEVER being updated
- **Impact**: Dropped frames always showed 0 even when frames were lost
- **Fix**: Now properly tracks dropped frames in capture loop

### 2. GRUB Boot Delay
- **Bug**: 30-second delay after any improper shutdown
- **Impact**: Production boxes slow to recover after power loss
- **Fix**: Set `GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=0` for instant boot

### 3. PTP Time Sync
- **Bug**: PTP showed unavailable when USB disconnected
- **Impact**: False indication of time sync failure
- **Fix**: PTP now correctly independent of USB device status

### 4. --version Command
- **Bug**: Command would hang trying to initialize hardware
- **Impact**: Unable to check version quickly
- **Fix**: Early exit before hardware initialization

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Removed Duplicate Scripts
- Eliminated 183 lines of inline scripts from `10-tty-config.sh`
- Single source of truth in `scripts/helper-scripts/`
- No more confusion about which scripts are active

### 2. Simplified Documentation
- CLAUDE.md reduced from 338 to 101 lines
- Clear, actionable instructions
- Known issues table for quick reference

### 3. Metrics System Architecture
- Structured logging: `METRICS|FPS:60|FRAMES:1234|DROPPED:0|LATENCY:5.2`
- Collector service parses and stores in `/var/run/ndi-bridge/`
- Welcome script reads from tmpfs for real-time display
